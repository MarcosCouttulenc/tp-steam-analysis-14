281610,Homeworld: Deserts of Kharak,"Having played a lot of Homeworld with its finelly tuned control scheme, H:DoK control scheme surely is not. Right clicking puts the mouse in view mode rather than interpreting it as a move order. Control-dragging often results in a selection rather than an attack box. The alt-click and alt-drag to focus from HW is sorely missed, instead click F to focus on selected unit(s) together with a hit-and-miss selection function (it is more difficult to select units than one should expect from an RTS.  - Story is fine so far.   - Graphics (except the lo-res stuttering cut scenes used sometimes instead of game engine cutscenes) is what I expected and wanted from the HW devs and art directors.  - Sounds and music are as good as HW.  - Controls are so irky, quirky and sub par, I don't want to ruin my experience by continuing until the game has been patched. I hope it's not a Unity engine issue but only an unfinished, untuned release.  In the state the game is now and for the current asking price I unfortunately cannot recommend the game. I got everything I expected except from the control scheme that is neither up to HW nor RTS standards.  Will come back after a patch or two though and promise to change my No to a Yes. I wan't to believe ;)",-1,1

1840,Source Filmmaker,"This is the easiest 3D animation studio I have ever used. It's incredibly easy to do just about anything apart from literally modelling that you would in a proper 3D animator. Definitely would recommend for beginners who want to toy around with 3D to see what it's like.  I only wish Valve would update this more, it's such a good tool",1,0
1520,DEFCON,"  Defcon first thing I have to say in my review. I love the game is motto, everybody dies. Also upon launching the game and gazing upon the menu. I noticed that apparently the official URL for the games website is titled. Defcon Everybody  dies.Com , which I personally found to be absolutely hilarious. Also I love the plot of the game which is apparently it is 1983 and you are a General, Hidden away in an underground fallout shelter. While are you are leading your chosen alliance into total Nuclear armageddon. Simply just the setting and the plot of Defcon reminds me of the novel, On the beaches. In that novel pretty much the same thing happens at the end, everybody dies, no survivors. I love the art style of the game, which reminds me of a radar screen thing. I also love how the game plays this very eerie music, that simply reminds me that this is the end of the world. And I am a guy who appreciates excellently written and performed game soundtracks.   But so far I've only played against the AI, but I still found the matches to be extremely entertaining. Even though a lot of people would say otherwise. Because I simply love strategy games. Defcon is simply right up my alley. It is just simply mesmerising to me seeing my nukes giving hell to the Russians, especially Moscow. And also see Beijing getting flattened at the same time as well. But when the match is over, and the population display is entirely red. Indicating that everyone has been practically annihilated in those areas. And the matches final score is tallied. For some reason it feels so dam rewarding to have practically murdered so many millions of people. And my real first match I played as what is practically the EU. (before the UK left) in a solo match against the USSR AI. I murdered as my final score 45.6 million Russians. Even more people than Hitler and Stalin combined could have ever hoped for. But they are all Communists, so who gives a dam?! Also I may have killed Putin as well loI. love how when you start a match you have a brief moment of calm, before the storm when everyone is on Defcon 5. For you to decide your strategy. Placing down your missle launches/air defences, fleets, bases, and finally your radar stations. Also the game does have modding support which is really neat. But so far the only mod I've seen is a mod that changes the map to an real world map.  But however I do have a couple of issues with Defcon. I don't like how in a full match it is practically just a big free for all. No allies or alliances, but I supposed you got give some slack. After all, it is the end of the world. So why the ♥♥♥♥ not as we give the UN, The only thing a supposed to be stopping a total nuclear war from happening. The middle finger, as we go into the point of no return, otherwise known as Defcon one, everyone will die. Also the normal asking price for the Defcon is 11.99 NZD. Is a bit too much in my opinion considering that Defcon doesn't have a lot of content or replay ability. I think 5 NZD is away more reasonable asking price. However I bought my copy on sale, 85% off - 1.79 NZD. Which I think in my opinion is way more reasonable, and you should deathly wait for a sale to buy Defcon. But for mods there are no steam workshop support, which is quite unfortunate.   But above all as my final conclusion. I can happily conclude that Defcon is deathly a game worth buying and recommending, for anybody who loves strategy games. Especially if you are like me, and loves post apocalyptic books and so on. If I was to give an score rating of 10. It would be 6 out of 10.",1,1
246900,Viscera Cleanup Detail,"Fun but tedious  I love how much fun this game is! It really never gets old. From cleaning arms and legs to full on dead bodies and even 11ft. tenticles! The only issue is, the game is quite tedious. When you first start you're likely to be overwelmed, but the maps only take 2-3 hours on solo. But picking up 100 peaces of brass really gets old and whats worse is when you spill your waste bin and have to pick em' all back up. Of corse, I am exaggerating, but 30 things a' brass gets old quick.",1,0
241600,Rogue Legacy,"Reminiscent of From Software's Souls series, this game can be grueling, but rewarding. The core gameplay is a lot of fun with really frantic action and high mortality rates, and it is tempered with the ability to upgrade your keep (and subsequently yourself), armor and equip runes. Lower level upgrades are essential to all skill levels, and also present the player with new gameplay options by unlocking new classes, but at the higher levels these help to keep less skilled players alive longer and give even skilled players a fighting chance against the later sections. With randomized dungeons and rewards, the replay value is really high, unfortunately it also causes the game to slow down towards the middle if you don't have the skill to progress and haven't encountered enough upgrades in the dungeon to help outfit your character in a way that matches your play style.  I would recommend it at a sale price of $6-$8.",1,0
230050,DLC Quest,"Paid 0.98 € and it was worth it.  The game mechanics aren't something new. Platform game with the usual mechanics (small jump/long jump/double jump/wall jump) and so on so on.  It's a short game, really short one. Probably 1/2 hours to beat everything.  The brilliance of this game comes from how it was written. A great satire to the world of video games nowadays.  Another great thing are the references to other games ,old and new. ",1,0
215530,The Incredible Adventures of Van Helsing,"Van Helsing is a great loot based game akin to Diablo, Torchlight and games such as those. Probably what makes it stand out is that the character you play, Van Helsing, has such a more engadging personality than most almost voiceless heroes of other similar games. There's some great chatter between him and his AI companion who is incredibly useful and easy to set up. In addition to this the people you meet are voiced well, over the top in so many ways and also fun to interact with (We are talking Vampires with the oh so wonderful Transylvanian accent.).   Combat is about to be as expected. I've gone with a ranged firearm build. it works well and hits hard. But likle most ranged characters in this genre you are always limited to what you can see on the screen. So you usually only have a chance of having a real ranged battle with enemies in the top right and top left portions of the screen.   Probably one of the best things when it comes to loot in this game is that you get an incredibly useful breakdown of how it will increase your stats. Unlike Torchlight II which I have also played recently, it does all the maths for you and will say how much your DPS will be improved for everything that increases damage in some way. i.e Damage, Extra Elemental Damage Bonuses, Critical Chance, Critical Damage, Attack speed, Stat increases and so on. The same goes for things like protection and so on. This means less time agonising over what new weapon or armour to equip (I'm looking at you Torchlight &amp; Borderlands) and more time getting stuck into the action. The skill trees are straight forward as well and you can reset your stats in the game almost whenever you like back at the main hub.  One of the biggest drawbacks of the game is that it frequently crashes. I've been playing for sometime now and have had over 50 crashes to my desktop. The majority of the crashes are usually when you teleport to a location or you accept a quest which automatically takes you to a new area as well. But there are a number of other minor causes as well. Automatic save points are frequent though so you never feel like you have been cheated out of a quest. But nevertheless it happens over and over again.   Other things to mention are neat features like a Tower Defense game that pops up later into the game which is fun to play and simple management of upgrades for your main hubs and shops. This game also has multiplayer which I have yet to play but I have not heard great things about.   I recently got a 50% off voucher for the next game in the series. So I am eager to pick it up once I have completed this one!   Overall I recommend this game highly if you see it at a reasonable price and you enjoy the genre!",1,0

212680,FTL: Faster Than Light,"FTL is a game about dying against all odds, and then surviving against all odds.

418340,RWBY: Grimm Eclipse,"EDIT: Launch release  Everything good about this is still there, and everything that was problematic has been fairly well fixed.  The only issue I have found, is that when I attempt to go into multiplayer campaign New Game, it just drops me into a pre existing lobby.  Best update to the game in the full release is the persistent characters.        EDIT: Forever Fall Update.  Awesome new content, nice feel to the difficulty increasse with the addition of new Grim subtypes.  My only issue with this is that the level cap is still at 10, I feel this should have been raised.   This so far is the best Hack N Slash game I have played, and I have played a lot of them over the last 15 years.  If you have a 5.1/7.1 sound system the music gets truly epic in intensity that headphones just can't match.   The only feature that I really want to see added to this is character lockout so you can't have two Ruby's in the one game. Or three in one of the games I played, it became a blender for grimm, and nearly no kills for my poor Yang.  I also feel that Ruby should be rebalanced a little, More sniper damage and slightly less Scythe damage. Ruby is currently OP and kinda easymode.",1,0

261640,Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel,"There's no way I can recommend this for 60€. It's more of an expansion pack and should be priced accordingly. I've only played the first Borderlands but this is literally the same thing with a few new weapon types, locations, classes and enemies (although many of the enemies are kind of reskins). The new oxygen system doesn't provide anything to the game, it's only an annoyance and so is the low-gravity. Sure it's fun to float around for a while but not for the whole damn game. The moon makes me want to return to Pandora so bad. Also Claptrap's ultimate gives a random effect to the whole team and sometimes it's an annoying one like wasting all of the ammo for everyone. What on earth were they thinking when they made this skill in a co-op game? There's also way more backtracking than in the first Borderlands and the moon feels too big for its own good, you often get lost since the environments are confusing and pretty much always the same.",-1,0

105600,Terraria,"Being a big Minecraft fan, but desiring a bit more on the adventure side, I decided to try Terraria. I was not disappointed. The larger variety of gear among four distinct combat playstyles, the multitude of bosses with a progression to how you handle them has had me hooked.  This is all while not sacrificing the ability to build and create. The ability to hammer a block after you've placed it to create edges with 16 bit retro graphic style allows for a lot of details and depth to world-building that it's 3D voxel brethren cannot compare to.  As a final praise to Terraria, this game stands tall at the top of the list in my entire library when sorted by playtime.",1,0

Finally a good rally racing game since the Colin McRae and TOCA Race Driver series, at last Codemasters does it right.

263620,Mitsurugi Kamui Hikae,"I got this game in a bundle, and was unsure whether or not I wanted to keep it. After reading numerous comments and reviews about MKH, I decided to give it a try - and was really happy to get a chance to play through it.  If you enjoy Japanese-themed swordsmanship with challenging technical mechanics, fighting mobs of enemies, and grinding for upgrade systems, then you will really enjoy this game.  The aesthetics are fantastic - the detail in the different character models is very good, and the fighting special effects is well-done. The music and sounds are great, adding a high level of intensity to the brutal, fast-paced gameplay. The cutscenes are short but sweet, and add an anime-like feel to the narrative. Although fairly basic, the story is decent enough to keep you interested in the plot (although the fighting mechanic definitely is the shining gem for this game).  The controls can be challenging to learn - especially if you do not use a controller. The move list and tutorials are helpful, however, the default keybindings make keyboard play unnecessarily difficult. That being said, I completed several playthroughs without a controller (I will be attempting to complete it on the hardest difficulty with a controller, since keyboard play is far too brutal), so it is possible if you have no alternative. The learning curve is moderate to challenging because the later stages (and higher difficulties) really require you to utilize more advanced moves - like countering and parrying. If you cannot do this in the later levels (and/or difficulties), you will not get very far.  Each 'level' consists of multiple waves, followed by a boss fight. Every enemy type follows a particular attack pattern that you can memorize and use to your advantage, adjusting your playstyle accordingly. For each kill you make, enemies may drop health or experienc orbs - experience is added to your total pool, which can then be used in the abilities store (you can access this at any time by pressing ESC).   There are a variety of things you can unlock and upgrade - in particular, improving your health and 'katana energy' gauge (used to perform moves with your sword) is crucial to survival and chaining more combos. Improving your normal attacks will allow you to do more damage, refill more of your energy bar (hand-to-hand attacks refill your energy), and increase attack range, among a multitude of other things. You can also unlock a deadly counterattack, which is essential for defeating higher-tier enemies, and even bosses. Special attacks can also be unlocked and improved, however, it is entirely possible to complete at least one playhrough without further enhancing these things (it will just make it more difficult).   For achievement hunters, it can be both very fun and very lengthy to unlock every achievement in the game.  Overall, the game is a lot of fun, and technical players will appreciate the depth of the possible fighting controls and combinations. Definitely give this game a try.  Recommend!

233130,Shadow Warrior,"I really liked the original Shadow Warrior. A contemporary of Duke Nukem 3D and running on the same engine, it followed the mould for first-person shooters of the time by having varied levels, lots of enemies, a formidable difficulty level and a 3D engine that wasn't quite up to what the designers wanted to do at times. And, of course, a protagonist that spouted silly one liners at every opportunity.  The new Shadow Warrior is an interesting blend of old and new. There's clearly some old-school level design DNA in there, because the levels are all far from being Call of Duty-style linear corridors. The main route through each level is usually pretty obvious (and if it isn't, the game makes the next door you should go through glow) but, unusually for a modern shooter, there are plenty of opportunities to explore, leaving the main path of the level to 'go and see what's over there'. The game is packed with secrets of this type and is immensely rewarding for those who like to explore. There are even a number of 'retro' secret areas that make use of the low-res textures from the original Shadow Warrior and flat lighting -- not only do these provide pleasant fanservice for fans of the original, they also allow you to see immediately how far we've come in terms of graphics.  And boy, new Shadow Warrior is one hell of a looker. It's absolutely gorgeous from start to finish, with beautiful lighting, excellent texture work, interesting level designs and a variety of different environments. Plus it pays homage to the original Shadow Warrior and its other Build-engine contemporaries by setting the majority of its action in 'realistic', relatable locations like city streets and parks, much as Shadow Warrior, Duke Nukem 3D and Blood all did.  The biggest surprise to me was how much I became invested in the story. In the original Shadow Warrior, again like its contemporaries, the story was largely throwaway, delivered mostly through the game's help text and short ending sequences at the conclusion of each episode. New Shadow Warrior, meanwhile, not only spins some convincing original Japanese-style mythology, it also converts protagonist Lo Wang from the admittedly amusing dirty old man he was in the original to a convincing (and younger) hero who has a genuine journey of development and self-discovery over the course of the narrative.  He still spouts cheesy one-liners at every opportunity, but he does so with a certain degree of self-awareness, even giving up halfway through one at one point in the game and choosing instead to just say '♥♥♥♥ your mother' to the demon hordes he is attempting to dispatch at that moment.  Gameplay-wise, new Shadow Warrior is solid, too. Here it diverges a little from old-school Shadow Warrior's formula in that you don't encounter a trickle of enemies constantly as you explore the level. Rather, new Shadow Warrior adopts a somewhat Painkiller-esque approach, splitting each level into discrete encounters that sometimes consist of several waves of enemies in succession. They're monster arenas, basically, but the level design ensures that this structure doesn't become overly tiresome; it's pretty rare you'll just be dumped in a big room with a bunch of monsters. Instead, there will usually be plenty of cover to dodge around, destructible objects with which you can do additional damage and perhaps even some secret hidey-holes where you can get an advantageous position.  New Shadow Warrior's combat is exemplary for the genre. It doesn't overburden the player with a ton of possible weapons that all do basically the same thing (hi, Call of Duty) -- instead, much like its old-school inspiration, it gradually introduces each weapon to the player one at a time over the course of several levels, until by the end of the game you're the sort of walking arsenal you were in '90s shooters, with each and every weapon having a situation in which it is useful. And the weapons feel great, to use; the shotgun is a particular highlight, having not only a satisfyingly loud noise, but the potential to blast pretty much anything into a fine paste.  Also worthy of note is the melee combat, which plays quite a central role for much of the game. First-person melee combat is often a bit crap, consisting of flailing wildly until someone falls over -- indeed, the original Shadow Warrior's swordplay was rather like this. New Shadow Warrior, meanwhile, has a convincing feel of impact to its melee combat. When fighting melee-capable enemies, they'll block and parry your attacks convincingly, forcing you to outwit them. And with the game's various skill trees that you can unlock as you progress through the game, a double tap in a direction followed by holding one of the mouse buttons will unleash one of a number of different special attacks ranging from a simple powerful sword thrust to magic-like abilities that can control crowds, heal you, send out shockwaves or protect you from damage.  The reason the 'monster arena' structure works is that it gives you time to appreciate the game's wonderful scenery and excellent level design in between fights. If the action was relentless, you wouldn't have much of an opportunity to do this, and developer Flying Wild Hog clearly knows that they've made a very pretty game. Not only that, but keeping the action to predictable 'spikes' allows the player to take their time over combing the level for secrets without worrying about being attacked and potentially losing a ton of progress.  On the whole, I'm really impressed with new Shadow Warrior. It's one of the very best single-player first-person shooters (perhaps I should say first-person action game, due to the strong focus on melee combat) I've played recently -- possibly one of the best I've ever had the pleasure of playing. And in a world where the bigger budget FPS titles are increasingly bland and dull, Shadow Warrior is a breath of fresh air.",1,0
449830,,"What does “Muv-Luv” mean? Muv-Luv means tragedy, determination, alienation, hopelessness, love, comradeship, loss, peace, terror, war. “Muv-Luv”, like the game, uniquely belongs to Muv-Luv, it’s a nonsense word that means nothing in any language, but means so much to you the player. Muv-Luv is also the best damn story in any medium that I have ever experienced.   This review is basically spoiler free. Watch list is early in case you want to get right to it though. The only necessary things on this list are Muv Luv Extra, Unlimited, and Alternative, the rest though happen in the same place with much the same characters, they give important context and character development… let’s just say I did not watch them before playing the series and I still loved it but upon reflection I wish that I had.  Watch Order:  1 -Rumbling Hearts anime: at least 2 episodes, if you enjoy it continue otherwise feel free to stop. Direct prequel to Akane Maniax 2 -Akane Maniax anime: 3 episode long direct prequel to the muv-luv trilogy, the anime and VN are linearly connected 3 -Muv Luv Extra: You HAVE to play Meiya and Sumika’s routes, 100% required you play both to get the barest sense out of the trilogy. You also have to play Ayamine’s route in order to make sense of story later down the line. Chizuru or Miki’s route will help, but are not necessary. 4 -Muv-Luv Unlimited 5 -Muv Luv Alternative Chronicles Volume 1 VN: spinoff short stories, between Unlimited and Alternative. 6 -Muv-Luv Alternative  In case you need more convincing   You have never seen a piece of work that drags you through the depths of despair and tragedy until you have played Muv-Luv. This trilogy will give YOU the player PTSD, a few months of post-muv-luv depression is common. You cannot have loss without something to lose, you cannot have sadness without dynamic, well developed characters and a well-developed world. Also, yeah, characters and world building are the best of the best here. The trilogy is a hard science fiction series (yay), and a deconstruction of the mecha genre.  Extra and Unlimited are where you experience mostly character and world building and get invested, with a focus on developing the characters of the supporting cast. Alternative is where you finish up the world building (with all questions answered), and you truly develop the main character, then you tear everything down and viciously rip its head off, exposing the quivering mass beneath.   In Extra/Unlimited the music, artwork/animation, and story are all high quality but nothing game changing. Extra while a subtle parody plays like all the clichés in romantic comedies, but has a great cast and a sense of humor. Unlimited is a more unique story, and is surprisingly engaging considering how little outside of character development and world development actually happens in it. The main character is not insufferable, but is a bit annoying and feels at times a little flat in extra/unlimited (but that means his character has room to grow and be dynamic). The supporting cast is fleshed out and very well defined.  All of these become a 10/10 best you have ever seen ultra high quality in Muv-Luv Alternative, and in fact Alternative will make you improve your opinion retroactively. Extra/Unlimited is designed from the ground up to work for that payoff you get in Alternative.   The developers have stayed true to the things that made us all love and celebrate the original trilogy, while updating the art, sound, animation, just making it a more beautiful game. BUT, Developers, there is still work to do to finish up the game! You need to return to having Unlimited locked from the start! It is narratively important, especially that forced title change, and mechanically important due to saves imported, people can ctrl skip if they want so they still have that option anyways! There are not even any warnings that Extra comes first! Also give us back text speed options! Syncing the text to the voice was wonderful! And more options in general, like choice as to whether or not we have to deal with a jarring music volume change when there is dialogue. Great work so far",1,0

234140,Mad Max,"I wish i could like this game. The fact is that mad max does an incredible job of distracting you from its many flaws with pretty graphics. The combat is nice but nothing innovative (ripped straight from the likes of batman and assasins creed). My main problem with this game is the amount of time you need to spend clearing the many side objectives from your map. Its extremely tedious. Plus max doesnt even look like mel gibson or tom hardy, and doesnt even sound remotely australian (neither do any of the characters you come across). Also, why does max need to visit a crazed desert nomad apparition to level up?!  They give you a sidekick though.......a mental hunchback who works on your car, and, as much as his dialog may put a smirk on my face from time to time, his is not needed in this game. It wouldve been more satisfying to play this game without a comic relief side-kick, so that atleast you can feel like the lone badass that max is.  The car combat is quite nice, however, theres only so many times you can rip an enemy out of his vehicle with the grapple hook before that too becomes boring.  You want to know how heal in mad max? Your probably thinking its like the movie where you use bits of useful junk on hand to fasion iv's or some sort of transfusion system. Nope, you drink water....... who knew that being shot or run over could be cured so easily with just a sip of water! -.- Why this game has no multiplayer function is beyond me. It wouldve been brilliant to add a multiplayer element with unique character design and group options, maybe even base building. Imagine being able to form a clan (similar to immoton joes from the recent movie) and then procede to hunt other players or start turf wars to clear out other clans. The legendary battles would've been supreme......instead......your stuck with chumbucket. 3/10 will never play again.",-1,0

Though, I have to admit this game's graphics and combat system are not as good as Absolution but in my opinion it is overall a better made game. The levels have good contrast and are anything from being on a ferry to a redneck wedding, all using that same loveable 'win how you want' playstyle which Absolution tended to lack in. If you're looking for a great story with brilliant gameplay do not opt for this game. Instead, opt for Absolution. But if you want choice, freedom and personality buy this game now!",1,0

282210,Sid Meier's Starships,"I played for .9 hours. Im not being sarcastic but thats how long my game lasted. I accidentally went to war, won a battle or 2 but was not quick enough to pull a 'suddent-death' population victory. It was that quick. Certainly not worth 14.99. I would have liked and expected something more indepth- social engineering, ship design options, a Federation-esque council, an interface that reflects my affinity, maybe even a full screen presentation. Yeah, the Civ series was never one to show awesome graphics in units. The tradition still carries on with Starships. The ship designs look more like sprites from an old 2000s or late 90s game. Eitherway, its not detrimental. Its just I would have expected to see more in that arena of a game with the title 'Starships'.   Like other Civ games, opponents are placed way too close to me. Most interesting was that I was placed in a corner in Starships. Where is the buffer- the exapnse of space/planets that allow me some peaceful expansionturns? I know this is a civ simulator, war is going to happen but I always wonder why the AIs are spaced out but I am placed right nextdoor to an AI.   Diplomacy and/or War Room screens, like BE, are paintings. Nice to look at but offer nothing in terms of universe immersion. I can overlook the short game, the bland UI or cartoony ship models. But I am tired of seeing paintings. Give me a reason to care about my people, show me videos for Wonders (What is the Dadaleus Ladder?), show me more background on the faction leaders- do something! Please! For 14.99 (on top of the original 50 for BE), I have Chessmaster X in Spaaaaace. As someone who loves to get engrossed in story (and hearing that the fiction for this universe is kept at Firaxis), this not something I am overly happy about.   Perhaps its a bug or maybe its by design: At default, the game opened up in Windowed Mode. Going full screen still leaves the Windows Start and Task Bar visible.",-1,0

203160,Tomb Raider,"I picked this game up on sale. I'd heard mixed things about it, but I was pretty pleasantly surprised. Completed the main story (100%'d a couple areas, but certainly not everything) in about 10 hours. (Haven't tried the MP)  Liked: * Relatively forgiving platforming. The margin of error for grabbing things, jumping onto beams, etc. seems fairly large, and that makes for less frustration. * Killing dudes like Legolas. An upgraded bow combined with good reflexes and the bow-related skills lets you shoot enemies all day, then stab them with arrows if they take a swing at you. * Bonus XP for headshots. It always feel nice to be rewarded for something I'm trying to do anyway. * Getting progressively bloodier as the game went on. Unfortunately, I don't think the DLC outfits follow this trend; they stay immaculate.  Neutral: * The story. It was functional enough, but it had its rough bits, and some of the characters are rather flat. I'd bring up specific details, but I'd rather keep this review spoiler-free (since I am recommending the game after all). * Low accuracy on the rifle / huge spread on the shotgun. I guess the spread isn't huge by videogame standards, and the accuracy on the rifle isn't that terrible. I'm neutral on this because I like that it encourages you to use the bow and the pistol, but I like more accurate weapons. The shotgun is a gun, after all, not a melee weapon. * Weird puzzle physics sometimes. Not really gonna complain about this, since basically every game with some kind of puzzle does it. It's like how Link weighs more while wearing the iron boots than while carrying them.  Disliked: * Camp UI. I suspect it's intended to look pretty, but it just ends up handling poorly. * The way the skill system was done. It seems like a confusing compromise between flat and a tree. * Dudes with helmets that take 2 headshots to kill. (Okay, this is just a personal problem.) * Some of the collectable sets seem to just be there to collect, and don't really seem to have a reason to exist according to in-character logic. * Small QTE text. This was especially annoying towards the beginning when I was just getting used to the system, and had a hard time telling at a glance whether it was asking me to press E or F.  Overall: fun game, play it.",1,0

Cons: -Still a lot I think could be added -Characters themselves are a bit too slow movement wise in my opinion -Sometimes it doesn't register my mouse clicks in combat resulting in massacre by birds, blobs and everything that breaths -Doesn't have a brightness setting -No variation between what species/character you play as -Rather than many boss fights it seems to go more for the here is a dungeon so we're going to spam you with enemies in a small area.

It borrows heavily from other games but to the point where it feels derivative of them rather than being a synthesis of them. Moreover it is so blatant about it that it feels like it is flirting with the breaking the fourth wall not something I am a huge fan of.  The game has a lot of potential in the ship design and strategic aspect of space and ground combat and the level of depth that it allows you to manipulate your empire.  I will say that it was better than MOO III in general fun and striking a balance between allowing depth and getting carried away with it.  My big gripes about the game are as follows.  Technological advance doesn't yield significant upgrades until you get very very far along in the trees. I almost always had better luck researching a few basic (tier one or two technologies), the pumping everything into producion ships and troops and conquering the galaxy without ever doing more than cursory reasearch.  The AI literally cheats on basic settings, I have tested rich homeworlds on small maps with optimized industrial output and the AI will invariably massively outcolonize me and outproduce me (in terms of fleet and fleet size) very quickly in the early game. You can still win by being clever or cheesy in your builds, but the fact that it literally plays by a different set of rules on default settings really really bothers me.  The technologies are poorly balanced to create a stable empire. The game forces you specialize each of your planets because of prohibitive maintanence costs (making one planet that has all upgrades and buildings your empire is capable of will put a big dent in your wallet). Basically I find myself skipping almost all of my unlocked buildings on most colonies just because of what it costs to maintain them. The way various technolgies interact and overlap with each other just makes a lot of them feel useless or redundant or only of use on a very small proportion of your colonies.  I do think the game has a whole lot of potential and with some patches or balance changes could be more fun. Essentially my complaint it that it forces you to play in one of a few very specific ways if you want to avoid getting wiping out quickly on default difficulty. It felt more like how well can I implement this strategy which I know will be the only viable one for this map/race selection rather than what type of empire would I like to build this time. It feels like the game has mechanics for amazing strategies and fun but makes it impossible for you to implement them before you have already taken control of the map.

I finished game before that happened, but if you would run into heavy reduced resistances or find something like 'glass cannon' reducing hp by 80% instead of 50%, while giving +2 AP instead of 2x AP per turn, then you will know who to thank for that.

After playing with the editor for the first 30 minutes I already had a scene with a river, some trees and houses and a couple of bad guys, and I was ready to play my map through. Easy, fast and fun. That's for the basic functions. The advanced functions are not quite as intuitive and since there is no documentation, it took awhile to figure out for example how to play music or make player jump to another map. Fortunately there is live support and friendly community that can help newbies onward.  Graphics are nice and it's easy to change the amount of details. Frame rate was kind of low at first, but removing unneccessary graphical elements such as shadows and grass helps a lot. The engine always uses the resolution of the operating system, so playing the games on ultrabook with 2560 x 1440 resolution might not be the best possible idea. There is a way to force it to 800 x 600, but this feature is not visible in the editor and can only switched on from the setup.ini file on a stand alone game. Also game menus and loading screens can only be changed by editing the files in the stand alone game directory.   Possibilities to edit the gameplay such as weapons and player controls are limited. There are several actions player character is able to do, namely walking, running, jumping, shooting, reloading, aiming and crouching. As far as I know these can't be altered. This pretty much limits the possible game genres to different kinds of FPS:s. It is possible to change the view to third person, but currently there is only one model that can be used as a third person player character. The most unpleasant limitation of the games created with GameGuru is the lack of save/load game options. It is probably possible to create a way to save and load by LUA scripts, but it requires some imagination. However the development of the software is ongoing and the community of users can vote for new features.  There are a couple of ready made and fully functional materials (entities) that come with the editor. The selection is limited though: for example there are only two kind of building blocks for custom buildings (warehouse and asylum) and three kinds of enemies (soldiers, zombies and medieval things). The appearance of the entities can't be customized, but their behaviour is controlled by LUA scripts which provides theoretically unlimited possibilities. There is also inbuilt Character Creator for custom character design, which has a small set of hair/hat, face and body graphics and an option to import custom face graphic.   The default collection of graphics is just enough for simple war-, zombie-, fantasy- or cartoon game but pretty much exludes other themes. More entities can be imported from .x or .3ds files (there are certain rules the texture files must follow in order to work properly) and they can also be bought from GameGuru Asset Store or Steam.  Positive: + easy, fast and fun + has everything you need for a complete war-, zombie-, fantasy or cartoon game + LUA scripting + community vote for new features  Negative: - low frame rate - difficulty to locate certain features of the software - limitations (can't edit textures, other graphics, player commands or game mechanics) - no save/load game (although this can be created with LUA scripts and some imagination)  Do I recommend GameGuru? It depends. If you are a skilled programmer with a professional team and an intention to create the greatest game of all time, you might want to consider other engines. If you are a non-programmer with an attention span of a goldfish, this software is probably your best change to get something actually done.",1,0
211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Quite possibly one of the most fleshed out RPGs concept wise I've seen.

While a little rage inducing it is still one of my favorite games to revist to this day.",1,0
31280,Poker Night at the Inventory,"This game, is an amazing game of Poker (Texas Hold Em' to be exact) and you get to play against Max from Sam and Max, Strong Bad from Homestar Runner, Heavy from Team Fortress 2, and Tycho from Penny Arcade. This game has you betting and checking 'till you're the last one standing. Also, at random times, one of the characters might not have the money to join the game, so they put items up for grabs, and if you win them, you get them in Team Fortress 2. To win the items, you just have to knock them out. Max is the only one in the game that puts up two items, that are his Lugermorph and his badge (A Licence to Maim in TF2), Strong Bad puts up he pair of shades ('Dangeresque, Too?' in TF2). They Heavy puts up Sasha (Iron Curtain in TF2), and Tycho bets in his watch (Enthusiast's Timepiece in TF2). Once you've got these items, the only other real objective is to get all the achievements, which is easy considering there is only 20 (15 without the item grabs).  Overall, this game can be fun when on a plane trip, since it has character personallities, and doesn't have Multiplayer.  9/10, amazing game!",1,0

Spent many days training dexterity and strength, explore far distances regularly and take zero damage, until suddenly full damage and death.  UI is severely lacking. Stat system is incredibly basic.  Even Fallout Shelter had more depth than this game, and they are essentially the same thing.  Still not sure if it is early access or not.

200510,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"Im a fan of Xcom played the first 'enemy unkown', 'terror form the Deep', and my favorite 'Apocalypse'.  All over: If u like the setting and if u can stand pushed around by randomgenerators. u may get happy with it, it is not worth an normal price.  Thats why i say not recomendet. i buy it on an steam sale 4 less than 10€ with add on!  that was ok and thats an fair price 4 what u get. on normal it is playable with 2nd wave u can provide a bit difference in difficulty. If u wana buy it take it with the add on! That fixes at least some of the worst bugs. The regular Xcom is an alpha test phase you cant sell a single player game that looses saves -.- . and want to have money for the bugfix and rebalancing what the addon is in general. more details below ^^.  Style: is ok to good graphics: okay  Ki medium to bad (very skripted) Gameplay (miserable bugs over and over savegames disapere... at least that seems to fixed with the add on) in addition u have an hit% each time u fire dont forget that its -25% to the displayed worth at least. otherwise it becommes difficult to explain why you miss 2 100% shots in a row And the aliens hit far better exept u Mindcontrol them -.-  then they turn back to the displayed skill level.  U have to ensure each time that the curser is on the right building level cause the game assists you finding the wrong one.  Tactical:  groundfight: The enemy is not intelligent but ok equiped and outnoumber you far. if u be careless a wave of enemys sweep your entire team (only 6 man strong by maximum, why only 6) away (lowest number of aliens 2times 2 same as your team at start and only on 2nd difficult grade first mission). The add on bring a bit more diversity in it. Units: The Remote Tanks are redicules OP once they where fully upgraded and cheap to replace. normal Soldiers: Your so called elite soldiers wow the best of the best have one panicattack after an other where they loose next turn for shooting your own guys run or do anything else stupid. one of your guys get shoot and two with medium morale get panic so you loose half the maximum  you can bring in after one shoot. Adon: Gen Mutant Soldiers:  are an good ad on to the Tanks or mecs filling the few tactical gaps. the Mec Soldiers: are also OP very expensive hard to replace.  the enemy does not adapt but having the better units and more of them the big missions  have around 30 Aliens around 10 oneshoot an normal soldier ore mind control them. but they stupid enough that you can win.  Airfight not worthy an own chapter but if you want to know read it:  -.- you have that Hangar at each contianing up to 4 fighters and can send single fighter to duell 1 on 1 with familyhouse to skyscaper big UFOs. no real tactical choises 3 buttons to activate or not additional equipment. if u have build the right oneway equipment before.  Oh there is choise that you have, you can retreat by your own without any aditional equipmnent.  Just rediculess and boring.  (once you have the high end figter you activate evasive add on  against big ones and blast every ship out of the sky)  The hard part: The greatest problem you have in game are the low resurces you gain.  You have to sell alien stuff to evolve fast enough  on higher difficultys even unanalysed things. Just not to loose to fast once you get the better equiped forces its low tactical grade shows up.   i wish to say: Dear Developers try it with more grades of difficulty. Normal is ok if u reach the nessecary level to fight the enemys its some kind of boring easy. but if u go one step up its redicules 2 to 3 times more enemys with aditional skills. and at the top your base is missing some important upgrades u must provide to come on the level u need. That is an old Xcom illness perhabs u learn it someday -.-. that there are 4 grades of difficulty between your normal and your hard (only 4 hardcore Strategists that like savegame each round). but they will never read a letter from me so i let it down. The difficulty tends strong even if u start 2 times on the same difficulty i can be very different.",-1,0
239140,Dying Light,"Updated as of 2/18  A patch has been released that has upped the FPS for many people. My FPS have increased by about 10 on average, but it's still not playable. Ill still get crazy dips, and turning off graphics options still does very little. Something is obviously wrong when I can get 60+ FPS in the quarentine areas, but cant average a stable FPS count out doors (looking around still causes FPS to dip anywhere from 50-25fps.   Again, the patch they released DID help, somewhat, but I still cannot reccomend this game. I have a GTX760 and 8350fx CPU. I should be able to maintain good FPS on AT LEAST medium specs. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Unoptimized.

277470,The Book of Legends,"Gotta Give Credit Where Due. It's hard to make a compelling RPG Maker game. Especially considering that Final Fantasy VI is my all time favorite video game ever. So when an RPG Maker game comes even halfway to the point of FFVI's brilliance, it's worth playing. Granted, I haven't played a ton of this game so far and may update my review later. Additionally, I'm only playing in Casual Mode, so I can't speak to the RPG Mode's balance/grinding aspect. (I don't have nearly as much time for games as I did in my youth, so the Casual Mode saves a lot of time for my adulting responsibilities.) Only down side for me so far is that the main character is a complete jerk. Fine narrative, but I tend not to root for these kinds of characters. Aside from that, there's lots to explore, side quests, and even a rooster companion. My ultimate point is that I've spent money on giving other RPG Maker games a chance in the past and gave up on some within minutes. The fact that I want to complete this game speaks volumes.",1,0

20900,The Witcher: Enhanced Edition,"This is usually no more than $5 and while it's not perfect, it's a hell of a good time once you get the hang of it. It's a first attempt (as far as I know) from the development team and they've done admirably; as I understand it, 'Enhanced Edition' stems from the fact they took customer feedback to heart and patched a lot of the worst bugs/glitches/bad decisions. Since Witcher 3 is on deck for September of 2014 and this is a fairly large (40+ hours?) game to get through, if you haven't played Witcher 2 (also recommended) and want to have a nice, shiny, complete save to import through the trilogy then you can't really go wrong with $5.

261430,AION Free-to-Play,"I have been playing Aion since 2006 /07, i still have my original hard copy and Game time cards, i paid for this and all cause i loved it, and i still love it. The game is beautiful, and the content which it contains is fanastic. its one of those games that you really get out of it, what you put in.   Since NCsoft released control of its european servers to Gameforge, admittedly the content flow and server stats have decreased alittle aswell as the amount of support and rewards you get for playing the game, if you compare the EU servers to the NA servers then installing the NA Client from  AION.COM  is probably a better option, ive been playing on both EU and NA servers since the game has been out, but i was originally paying to play on NA servers which has most of my characters, and which gets the most attention.   However this should not stop you from downloading and playing the Steam Client which is Gameforge, Gameforge do maintain and look after their servers very well, and like any MMO the people you meet are the people you meet, they all vary.   Aion is a graphicly Beautiful game, and its combat system, although alittle one sided, in the sense first hit is usually the winner ... in some cases, the combat effects and abilities are on their own level.   One thing about Aion which is incredible though even from the very start and has never changed even up untill now is the Music. Aion's compisitons are just incredible and so touching, there are many moments in the game which are just made so much more amazing but the music and even now when i watch shows or hear simalar music i immeditly am drawn back to Aion.   The game is not very taxing on your system thankfully even though it is an incredibly detailed piece of work, and there is a great vairty in weapons and armour aswell as cosmetic options, and their unique guild system which is called a 'Legion'.   One of the most noticable and key features of the Legion system in the game is the emblem, where you can choose from their exising selection, or you can design and upload your own Emblem which is then usable on your cloak, Horse Armour, and on your Shield! This is a feature which i have always loved because it means that every Legion is then unique and those designs are more noticeable and rememberable.   Even though the game went free to play i was worried when it happened but im not worried anymore, i am probably always gonna keep playing Aion because it holds a dear place in my Heart, and i strongly suggest that you download it and give it a try.   Do remember though as i said before, that this game will only give back what you put into it, so to some it may be 'grindy' but the end results show the hard work youve put in, and frankly i believe a great game is one which you get rewarded for working hard, not having it all handed to you on a silver platter.   And Aion is a Great Game!",1,1

22120,Penumbra: Black Plague,"Well, as a second review, I want to make this as positive as can be. Penumbra points out the pefect imperfections of human nature. Dark areas with whispering, slithering, crawling and screaming in the background allows for a more 'intimidating' experience. Enemies are fuel for nightmares, conjured up from the fears of fellow humans. The general atmosphere will make your heart pound and make you sweat. The good ol' fashioned jumpscares (how few they are) will last in your memories and well, deep into your dreams. Nightmares* excuse me.    Now, the ONE (1) bad thing I had was not game-ruining; a simple lighting error with the shader. A simple fix of course. Lower the shader resolution to medium. Bing, bang you're back in action! If you left in the first place.   My computer is nothing close to a gaming rig, however, Penumbra runs at above 60fps with hardly (meaning none) any lag ingame, don't be deterred if you're using a less-than-perfect machine.    10/10 would rebuy, reinstall and replay it over and over.",1,1

It runs well with a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ A10 6700 APU from AMD at about 30 fps evenly. and this game doesnt NEED 60 fps to keep looking good.  Lots of lore. a lot. like i cant stress enough how much. every mission or side op has some sort of lore to it.  i would say it has a the secret world feel without being the secret world. that being said it also has a great atmosphere. they nailed it with that too.  Cons Its mostly snow and contaminated looking areas.  They have a slider that determines how much you stream that part of the world at any given time. they should just make it load the whole or a lot of th3e world and have the rest of the world be on the HDD maxing this slider means long load times for slower internet.  Cleaners EVERYWHERE at least thats what the JTF think :P Not many helmets. i still havnt got my helmet &gt;:(   I hate the darkzone its ♥♥♥♥ BUT you can still get cool ♥♥♥♥ from it just bring a friend and make sure you kill anyone near you.  10/10 would play running simulator 2016 again and again.

248310,Freedom Planet,"Sega Fans:  Try and imagine that a Sega 32X game from the future suddenly arrived on a time-traveling motorcycle and said, inexplicably, 'quick! Get on! There's no time to explain!' It then wisks you off to an alternate timeline where Gunstar Heroes, Ristar, and Sonic the Hedgehog were the top charting games of all time and the Sega Saturn somehow beat the Playstation and N64. This is the game that introduces you to that timeline. You owe it to yourself to buy and play this right now.  People with No Context for that: Now that I'm done fanboying out, I'll tell you that if you played any of the Sonic games or any of the Mega Man games then Freedom Planet will feel familiar, but it's really its own thing. General controls and combat feel like a Mega Man game, but there's Sonic influences in that each level tends to have more than one path and there's a bit of emphasis on momentum, albeit not as much as in the actual Sonic games. There's a lot more margin of error, you have a health bar, and it isn't difficult to stop or change direction. You won't feel like you're controlling a pinball with legs so much as a very fast version of Mega Man who can cling to walls and run on ceilings.  In terms of production values, the game is influenced clearly from the best aspects of all of the above games, which all represent the finest platformers in the Sega Genesis catalogue. I mention the 32X because the presentation is a cut above those games, more in line with the 32-bit era of gaming than the 16-bit era, with more detail, more story, more color, voice acting, and a great soundtrack that goes beyond the indie chiptune status quo that you would expect from something like this.  Gameplay is a cut above the status quo as well. There's three playable characters with unique movesets and ways of navigating the environment. Each one is challenging and fun for different reasons and you'll have a blast taking apart enemies with their different blends of attacks. There are crazy-fun setpieces and tons of crazy-fun bosses galore. Every stage introduces unique enemies and obstacles, with very little being recycled between levels up until the end. Even then there's still new things being introduced as late as the last level. Everything sparkles, and EVERYTHING EXPLODES in the most satisfying way imaginable.  I will say it isn't without its rough edges. The physics are a bit odd, sometimes it feels like the characters are approaching top speed without ever reaching it, and the threshold for being able to cling to a wall with your speed seems a bit low -- which makes momentum-based obstacles easy to overcome, but they do feel a bit weird. There's some places where you can tell the designers were still 'feeling out' what's fun and what's a fair challenge, particularly with some boss and enemy designs. Something you need to get through your head in later levels is that you don't really get points for killing most enemies, so a lot of them are better left ignored or treated as stage obstacles rather than opponents.   These aren't really 'bugs' or marks against the game's fun factor so much as what you'd expect from 'first iteration' growing pains from a polished, finished, new product. It's comparable to what Ratchet and Clank 1 was like before its sequels refined its formula, and I'll be excited to see how Galaxy Trail improves on this base. Relative to the platforming world the experience stays fresh and satisfying for a good, long time, and relative to indie platformers this showcases by FAR a higher level of polish, effort, and variety than I'm used to seeing. There are established companies that don't make platformers this good.  I rate this at four weird, alien animal mascot characters out of five.",1,0

241540,State of Decay,"not a review writer, but I bought this game just because it was really cheap on exploration sale and I don't regret a single cent - if I knew that, I would buy it even without the sale. why? because it's immensely great game in every ways. graphics are good, but without antialiasing, which can be treated easily with tools (I googled it and it's not hard to force AA into the game). Gameplay is just perfect, you're dragged into the story so much that when you turn off computer, you seriously believe you're still in a zombie apocalypse. I was a little bit concerned about this auto-save system, which is quite uncomorftable when it comes to unexperienced playing of this game (you can end up dead just because you didn't know there's a function or a way to avoid dying, or just because you fell down from a cliff), which again can be solved by downloading a back-up-save program. I know, it's technically cheating, but that's my point, if you really want the game to be hard, then the auto-saving is perfect - if you rush in to a mission unprepared, you're dead and there's no turning back, which makes it obviously more realistic.  I really do recommend buying this, otherwise you would miss many hours of immense, realistic zombie-survival fun.",1,0

But what is great is the story, the only thing i can say it has some inception traits in here. Also the soundtrack is awesome, it fits so perfect with the story and pacing of it. It can be completed is and about 4 hours or less or a little more depends. I dont see a lot of replay value of it, unless you wanna just experince again and again.

Each map is incredibly small, barely more than two screen-sizes big. To advance all of your party members have to sit in a small space and you have to push space. It sounds trivial but it's just a very unfun boring process after the 10th time. It feels like the design gets in the way of what I want to do.  There's lots more to get into.

322500,SUPERHOT,"Mr Anderson,you may have defeated the Matrix,but you will never destroy it.Now,you are invading our home and we will do what it takes to get you out of our system....or even worse.  This game is a breath of fresh air compared to all them new games that keep the same fast-paced gameplay. In SUPERHOT you can take a break while the guy tries to shoot you and think of a way to kill him while time is going really,really slow.  I have heard about this game ever since it was still a prototype back in 2014,but the creators made this game after they participated in the 7 Day FPS Challenge.  Now,here are a few points on why you should buy the game: -Awesome story(not gonna give spoilers,but its a pretty short story) -Endless badass gameplay -Challenge mode.Can you beat the game with speciffic conditions like only melee or death timer? -The original experience(this one can be understood by the players who knew way back when about this game.basically,u play the same levels,but with the graphics of the 2013 version of the game and its limitaions,meaning u can only pick up guns but u can one punch the enemy). -Free updates.All the contents that will be realeased in the future will be totally free for the person who bought the game.  Now here are a few downpoints about this game: -Too expensive.Although it has an endless mode and an challenge mode,I don't think its worth to pay this much especially since the story is really short and the modes only repeat the same levels with different challenges.(those who preordered it had to pay only 14 dollars through paypal) -Repetitive.Although you might think it would be awesome to play the same level with different challenges,its still the same level.  My opinion? Well,it really depends on you and you only if you want this game or not.I recommend it to those who really know what they are getting for their money.Maybe in the future people will be able to make their own levels and have like a leaderboard to be even more competitive.I'm not saying is a bad game when it comes to anything.It's just that after some time you will get bored of just reapeating the same level over and over again just for some achievement.

224260,No More Room in Hell,"No More Room In Hell is about a group of survivors trying to make it out of a zombie infested hell. This game runs on the Source engine, starting out as a small-time HL2 mod. This game's high moments speak with the gameplay and graphics as the gameplay is difficult, but not Dark Souls, and the graphics look however you wish to set it as, of course. Good to play with a group of friends or complete strangers, NMRiH has it's problems, but you'll barely notice them. Remember this, however, you are not immune, leading to the frustrating hunt for pills to stop the infection and odds are, you're also probably bleeding to death and need to bandage yourself while zombies flock you like dogs. The complaints to me are that it's difficult to find a server and then load it up, and that the zombies seem like cannon fodder at times. If I have to warn you about anything, it's a not for the faint of heart warning as there are child zombies. Now, before you yell at me, I like the idea of a child zombies, as a zombie won't think twice about biting a child, its mind is gone and the kid will be lucky if they're not mutilated. My final thoughts are a 9.75/10.",1,0

203160,Tomb Raider,"Deep within the mysteries of Tombs, long lost forgotten from time and the history books, lies treasures, precious gems and adventure, waiting for you. This is what the new Tomb Raider is all about.   Action and Adventure fraught with peril, suspense, with plenty of excellent story telling and history is why I love Tomb Raider (2013). I've personally never played any of the previous titles of the Tomb Raider series (with the exception of demos) but, I've always read up on them since they existed back in the young days of 3D Gaming. Which is why I'm glad I waited because the developers of this game really took their time to create a well crafted (or 'Crofted) game like this that blends well with just the right stuff. The graphics are incredible and pleasing to the eye while you plunder the Tombs for lost artifacts.   Another interesting aspect of this game is how they didn't make the series overtly sexual like they did in previous titles. They made Tomb Raider attractive but more in a sense that the or her character as well as the player, caring for well being in surviving the adventure. Which made a fresh new take on her story as a character.   The controls are great, but not perfect. They're 100% better then the other Tomb Raider games before it and it really shines when the player engages in combat with the bad guys in the game. There are tons of upgrades to help Laura Croft defeat her adversaries as the Player progresses. However, in the beginning, the Player will soon find out that Laura Croft is very fragile and can die quite quickly if the Player makes the wrong decision, which in turn will get the Player killed (in vicious ways might I add), so tread lightly! All in all, the controls are Great!  I give this game a 9 out of 10 and GORE_TORNS OFFICIAL SEAL OF APPROVAL!",1,0

The voice acting is great, the sound is just fantastic, and the story is phenominal. I couldn't stop playing all the way until the end.  Now, here are the problems: The game is too short, it took 3 hours to beat. 3 HOURS! This game is not scary. It will spook you every now and again with the pigs, but that is about it. Don't expect to be chased down and watch the doors being torn open like in The Dark Decent. The good parts are as follows: The story is great. The audio is amazing, The voice acting is pretty darn dandy. The atmosphere is great, but nowhere near as good as Dark Decent. Now, this game is a LOT more disturbing than Dark Decent ever got. Dark Decent didn't even come close to some of the stuff that happens in this whenever it comes to morbidness. In conclusion, the game is worth a playthrough. If it is in the Humble Bundle, buy it. If it is on sale for less than $10, buy it. It's pretty good.",1,0

Orgins is probaly my 4th favorite map in all COD Zombies because the easter egg is ridiculously hard. My 3rd favorite map is Buried because it has the best camping spots if you have the right weopons like the Raygun Mark II and Paralyzer or a M126 Shotgun and a Galil. My 2nd favorite map is Der Riese because it is an original and its all together a very great map. My 1st favorite map is Mob of the Dead because of the easter egg and the Hell's Retriever and the Blundergat and the PaP Skin and Brutus and the Plane and training at the roof and running around the whole map training and me and my friend @colepark got to the round 34 which was hard but so fun.",1,0

244710,Shelter 1,"I bought this game because the premise was simple and from the video, the style was very neat - in a sense that it was interesting. It is, by far, 'neat'. While the game is fun, I had to change the controls to something more.. easily accessable. It took a little bit to figure out what to do, since it just throws you into the game.   First, I gotta say I love the models for the badgers and foxes. They're widdle and adorable. The noises and music are really nice, too. The second level gives you the 'creepy mood' without being over powering.  The textures are very... messy. Tiling textures can be a pain, but looking at textures sloppily added onto the objects is also a pain - on the eyes. The textures are nice, but since nothing seems to tile, it just looks like a big, unfinished mess to me. The grass patches are obvious squares that go in alternating directions. It wouldn't take too long to easily make the textures they have tile, becuase they are already quite simple; full ambient, no shading. It is unique in it's own little style, though. You quicky get over it and enjoy the game. I think at first I just found it rather jarring. I think my biggest pet peeve is the sky at night. Would it really be so hard to add glowing dots rather than what they have?? It looked like the cieling to a children's bedroom.  The camera seems to get weird during some places, and it doesn't matter if it's close up or far away. Sometimes it just... does a weird 'thing'. Turns itself around? Suddenly too sensitive? It's hard to explain, but it's super prominent in the second level, which was hard to explore. The levels aren't linear - which is usually a good thing - but I find it easy to get lost, only being able to know where I've been from the holes of wild growing.. turnips? I thought they were potted plants, at first. Hehe.  Anyway. The game is simple; maybe too simple. It's still fun, and I feel really bad for losing 2 cubs on the second level! If the textures tiled nicely, and didn't look like they were done in 10 minutes, this would be an awesome little game. It's easy to get attatched to your cubs once you figure out what you have to do, which can take a while to notice. From a distance, the environments are kinda pretty~   10$ is actually quite a lot considering, so I'm glad I got it for $2.50.",-1,0

The warband customisation is very satisfying - you can easily spend as long tweaking your warband as you spend fighting battles (just like the tabletop game).  If you know and love the tabletop game you should love this game too. If you do not know the tabletop game, it is good enough to stand on its own merits.

It allows for massive city expansion and a must have add-on to an already amazing game. 10/10",1,0
460120,Megadimension Neptunia VII,"Ahhh, console video games (or vidcons as I call them), the ultimate medium of expression, able to convey any emotion from hatred to love, loyalty to fear, all in front of your eyes. Ah, and with lovingly crafted art, music, and the ability to control the action, vidcons are the ultimate combination of the high arts. While I tend to play the stoic, I will be the first to admit that vidcons have driven me to cry, to scream and shout, to feel actual hate; such is the power of this force beyond our wildest reckoning. And here I am, before you, to tempt your tongues with the taint of such a tantalizing topic. And the Japanese, the true geniuses behind the world of video games. Pah, I throw my scorn upon such incompetents of the West who would mock the true art of the Japanese with 'games' such as Baldur's Gate and Madden. Perhaps the West is not as intelligent as the East, but this is a matter for another day. Japan has given us such masterpieces as the Final Fantasy series, Star Ocean, Wild Arms, and of course, Arc the Lad. Yes, some of the finest vidcons in the world were created by the Japanese. I come to you today to ask you in all earnesty, what is your favorite vidcon? I will reveal mine after the grand debate has illustriously begun, but not before the first poster falls victim to my plot of discussion.",1,1

313360,The Maker's Eden,"Q:  WHAT'S THE WORST THAT COULD HAPPEN WHEN BUYING AN UNFINISHED 3 PART EPISODIC INDIE GAME FOR $10? A:  THE DEVs COULD RELEASE 1 SUPER SHORT EPISODE THEN ABANDONED THE GAME FOR 2 YEARS &amp; THEN RELEASE A 22MIN GRAPHIC NOVEL... NOT AN ACTUAL GAME.  After playing the super short, but highly stylized demo I was sold. The futuristic film noir vibe was right up my alley. The illustrations were futuristic &amp; mysteriously beautiful, yet somber. The storyline was intriguing enough to hold my attention from interesting puzzle to puzzle. The writing, acceptable &amp; the last few puzzles all seemed very promissing... Like there would be so much more in the full game. So I chalked the super short demo up to the Devs not wanting to ruin the story's mystique &amp; I immediately purchased the game.   I justified justified spending $10 on an unfinished indie game because of the promise of 3 full episodes &amp; that seemed WELL worth it at the time. IT AIN'T WORTH IT PEOPLE. I take back everything nice that I said. EVERYTHING. smh  1. BOTH episodes are FAR too short (EP1 Puzzles/Story/Ok EP2 30min of reading, 0 Puzzles) 2. EP2 is just a 'Dialoague SImulator' with NO real puzzles or choices = ZERO FUN 3. Waiting 2 years for 30mins of reading?? W..... T...... F........ 4.

383870,Firewatch,"Stunningly beautiful game, both in art style and storytelling. Might be my game of the year when it is all said and done. You can really feel the love that went into making this game. They even included a developer's commentary track.   Pros  -The characters are so fantastic I immediately went into a bit of a depression when I finished the game, because I knew I was going to miss them. -Writing and dialogue is second to none -Voice actors are spectacular -Gripping story, I can't really say more than that because I really want everyone to experience it for themselves -The art is sort of a stylized realism. Just wonderful. -Runs well even on less than ideal machines. -While short, is a great value for the money IMO   Cons  -As I said, it is short. Took me about 4 hours to get through the first time. Worth $20 though? Easily. -A little bit of hitching for me occasionally in the transition areas, but I think that was just because I was playing it on one of my crappy 5400RPM storage drives rather than a 7200RPM drive or an SSD. -Not much action. For me, as a grumpy old man, this is perfectly fine. If you don't much care for more laid back, story driven games where exploring and character development is the main focus, this may not be the game for you.  Overall, a big recommend from me. Give it a try, and if the style or gameplay doesn't suit you, refunds are available. 9/10 will play again.",1,0

It doesn’t give us most of the features that were promised and brought people in. The main one that I was disappointed in was the large scale space battles. The closest I saw to this was rebels attacking one big ship and you could fight the rebels or help them. It wasn’t even close to the “large scale” space battles that were promised. Also when launching the game I get stuck in the loading while you fly through the galaxies. Overall it is a good game but it isn’t good enough because of what the promised.",-1,0

Holy ♥♥♥♥, this game is amazing. An nice game that has many addicting features mainly based on leveling up your character and party from the begining. Start out as what could be considered a peasant and work your way up to be either the best knight in the country or to be supreme ruler of the continent. Countless of mods extend the time that you'd spend on the native module, ranging from extended features, adding new troop trees, even mods that change the whole game and change the whole setting of the game. Fight along side your favorite LOTR characters, slicing orcs and wargs down. Scramble for the throne in A Game of Thrones mod. Fight for control of the Japanese islands. Anything you could imagine would be good for this game, it's there. You'll find an extensive community surrounding the game that constantly add new ideas and improvements to the game. Not to mention, a brand new game is coming out of the developers soon to even further extend your M&amp;B experience. Buy This Game",1,0

I also love that it is an MMO, AND I love the story progression and the leveling process the game has. It gives you chances to make you're own avatar to be unique to most tennos in some ways. Different types of warframes that you can customize with some limitations, but either way, it gives you the chance to be unique than most players. There is in-game currency which is more reasonable. You can still have most of the perks without buying platinum, but other things requires platinum to obtain, but the price is a little more reasonable, and af♥♥♥♥ble for extra purchases for spare cash. The in depth graphics makes it run for top notch video cads, which my computer happens to not have, but with a little computer tweaking I can make it run. This game will require massive computer juice, meaning you'll need a pretty beefy computer to run at mediocre specs. My computer can run this game at real low specs, but it stilll has very good quality graphics even at the lowest settings. All in all, anyone who is a true gamer, I highly recommend this game.",1,0

The unique controls (one 'half' of a controller for each brother) make it unlike anything else out there, and the ease of the controls make it very accessible to almost all audiences.  A great game if you want to feel something epic and substantial in a short period of time (like a lazy afternoon on a weekend).

There is only one zombies map but it is huge and full of easter eggs.",1,0
269210,Hero Siege,"Для русского - см. ниже. Diablo 2 humped The Binding of Isaac and after some time we got this. It obviously bears resemblance to both its parents and I can't say for sure which one influenced more. I guess it's D2 (as I personally spent more hours in it than in Isaac). Is it worth the price? If you are not sure, buy it on sale. It's definitely worth it. Even with DLCs (the devs keep telling that they are not making any new ones, but they're really bad at keeping their promises). Well, the DLCs are a kinda weak spot, but they offer some additional fun mechanics and I really loved the very last one (Wrath of Mevius) for DemonSpawn character. If you used to squander hundreds of hours in Diablo 2 or its hack-n-slash clones (Torchlight, Sacred, whatever), you'll definitely like this one. If you like rogue-like randomizers, you'll be obsessed with it just as much as I am. If you don't like such genres.... What the heck did you forget on this page?  Это - внебрачный ребёнок The Binding of Isaac и Diablo 2. Больше, наверное, от Диаблы, но чёрт его знает. Стоит ли купить? Если вы спустили не одну сотню часов на хак-н-слеш гринд в Диаблу и его клоны (Torchlight, Sacred, сотни их!), берите. Хотя можете подождать распродажи, хотя бы из-за многочисленных DLC (разрабы каждый раз обещают, что вот этот вот - последний, но эта телега не меняется уже третий раз; ну и ладно, последнее расширение дало нам очень кошерный класс DemonSpawn и интересный новый акт, которые явно стоят своих денег).

206440,To the Moon,"Hardly an adventure or RPG at all... In a very small, confined area, you find the places where your cursor turns into a hand or a magnifying glass and you click all of them. You do a series of puzzles which are all in the same format, but no score is kept and they never increase in difficulty. That's it. The storyline is completely linear; there are barely any choices to make and none which have any effect on the eventual outcome. The 'humour' is somewhat awkward and juvenile and at times jarring. Buggy, imprecise mouse controls. The soundtrack is ok. I like the recurring main theme but there are some other weird choices of background music.  Spoilers (though not explicit) -- I'll say the premise is interesting but I don't find the story to be touching, uplifting, or inspiring. It's really about a guy going to his death without being able to make sense of the one thing which has bothered him for most of his life and, having given up on trying to understand, choosing to cover it with lies instead, cheapening his own memories and disrespecting the memory of the wife who predeceased him. Not sure if that's the idea that the writers want you to come away with, but I suppose there IS some value in pondering that.  But there are also some pieces of the plot which don't seem to fit, and a bunch of moments when the characters are difficult for me to relate to.  For 4 hours of 'play', I'd say the price is about right at 85% off.",-1,0

I've played through the game start to finish about 5-7 times and I still don't have all the achievements. The collectibles are extremely fun and there's only one that I had to look up where to find it (the 11th core). All in all, I recommend this game to any fan of Metroidvania games and puzzle platformers. My only complaint is that backtracking is severely limited, but it's OK because the game is so short.

45710,Dark Void,"One of the biggest failings on consumer's part in a long time, this game, while criticized justly, is really unique and deserved better reception/sales. The game revolves around the use of a Jetpack and it does so in such a beautiful way it is like playing a air combat game like Ace Combat one moment, then with the press of a button you switch to hover mode and its like the jetpack parts of San Andreas but with nice and responsive controls. And finally once you hit the ground, it becomes a competent third person shooter with standard cover mechanics. Except if you are by a ledge where you take vertical cover and fire down or up on enemies. The vertical cover moments really feel like those crazy moments in the Time Crisis arcade games where your character uses something really rediculous for cover, like in Time Crisis 3 where you take cover by a ledge then hang upsidedown to return fire. And then at any time you get bored of the ground you hit a few buttons and you are flying away like you just hijacked an airplane in Just Cause 2, which you can actually do using your jetpack incase you want some extra protection.   The criticism leveled at the game isn't wrong, although for me I had no issues with controls or framerate, but I think that was console criticism. There was 1 part early on that caused a CTD but running the game in windowed mode got me past it and afterwards the game only had 1 more crash which is pretty good considering Triple A titles everyone owns crash more frequently.  The game sadly suffers from being either too ambitious or being rushed, there are a few rapid jumps through time where it feels like the developers had an extra hour of gameplay planned and skipped it, and this really does make the game in the end sort of disappointing, however once you get your rocketpack addition to the jetpack, you will want to just fly around and never stop. But the game does stop, and it stops very abruptly and the poor reception the game got probably means we won't see a game with this type of unique gameplay for a long time.  If you enjoyed using the grappling hook in Just Cause 2, the Sky-Rails in Bioshock Infinite, the VTOL vehicles from Saints Row, or just the idea of freeroaming huge areas with a jetpack, you won't regret buying this game at it's current price, and if its on sale you are doing yourself a disservice by not getting it, its not an epic, but it is something anyone who wants to be able to fly around a series of huge battlefields should at least give a try.",1,0

This is just about two parents telling the story of how their child struggled with cancer and what it did to them. their faith and their beliefs.   I'll be a man about it, I will admit this game teared me up twice over its two hour span, once in the middle and then at the end.

275850,No Man's Sky,"This is a fantastic concept and I applaud Hello Games for taking a risk here. The game in its current state feels like it should be a beta.  The numerous glitches and performance issues can be fixed easily so I won't complain too much about them. To put it out there, the game is far too overpriced for an indie title.  In terms of gameplay the planets are far too populated and points of interest are too common, it feels nothing like you are an Explorer as was advertised, all the planets already have outposts with teh main factions in them. Intelligent life and life in general is everywhere, this really shatters the immersion. Coming across life should be a special occasion, not run of the mill.  Of all the planets I have visited all but one had animals and all had plants with numerous point of interest dotted every 500m.  This has got to be by far my biggest disappointment about this game. I followed it from the start and this seems like they sold out to the hype for mroe to do.  Flying and landing are very painful, I am not sure what they were thinking with this. WTF. It si bearable but flying is not fun (Dare I mention spore). In stations there are no NPCs walking arounf or anything, everything is static there. Not too annoyed about that, it is just noted.   On the plus side, I thought the terrain generation and HUGE planets with rolling weather patterns to be absolutely fantastic. Top job there with great variation.  With the animals though, the same model with random bits stuck to it gets rather old but I am not too fussed about that, there is still a lot of variaion with some entertaining combinations.  Crafting is another strong point IMO, though it would be nice to have a similar feature with the multi-tool as the ship. Where you could swap the parts before trading, some of those mods are expensive.   As much fun as I have had with it, I cannot reccomend it for this release price. The fans cannot help but feel lied to with a lot of the stuff.  Edit after a while: The fans were straight conned and ripped off. They knew they would never be able to live up to SMs promises and so chucked up the price ready to run. I hope they never make another game.

But i have to admit I disliked the call of beastmen dlc and I find it lacking in fetures for the price but other than that this game is extrodinarily awsome,1,0

9900,Star Trek Online,"I've always been a fan of Star Trek, and this game offers another path into it. Its great to see that some of the actors in the series have been part of it by supplying thier voices. It's definatly a commerical draw in the aspect where by you need to pump a lot of real life money into the game to have some of the cool things, but so far I've been happy with the choices Ive done on a limited budget. For those of us who like single player games, its a good mass multiplayer game to play single player, yet have more than enough real players to make it not feel like a SP game. I also like the development of constant new content and updates.",1,1

304050,Trove,"When this game first came out, it was amazing so much do it in the game.  But that's when the game first came out. Whilst this game is still quite a good game to play but you will quickly come across the problem of grinding for hours and hours. I'll go into more detail on the CONS near the end.  PROS: -Great fun with friends if you're all new to the game! -The massive range of items in the game -How they submit workshop creations into the game -They keep updating this game and adding more content e.g. new classes! -This game is 'Free 2 Play'  CONS: -The grinding in this game is stupidly long. -In-game purchases -Quickly gets boring if you're a casual player  Okay, the reason why i'm not going to be going into the PROS into more detail as they're self explained from my view. But i'll be going over the CONS as quite a large range of people who've played this game have encountered this problem as i have.  First CON: The grinding. If you're a casual player as i am when it comes to this game you'll quickly notice on how much a grindfest this game is. This CON is quite a personal opinion as other people might love this game for the grinding as it gives them something to do for hours on end. Okay, once you start this game you'll notice on how easy it is to start but as you get bout the first 4 hours in you'll notice on how material you'll need for your new weapon to upgrade but you'll just go along with it untill you finally notice how it takes about a few more hours to just level it up once which to me is quite stupid.  Second CON: With the in-game purchases this is completely optional, but what the in-game purchases give you are quite stupid. But the in-game purchases you don't have to purchase but what they do is give you quite a big edge on things which is why you'll see alot of reviews saying 'Pay 2 Play'. In my opinion i don't see the game as 'Pay 2 Play' as i haven't spent a single penny on this game and personally have gotten quite far into the game but i can see where the others are coming from.  Third CON: If you're a casual player like me, you'll notice on how bored you'll quickly get as this game will take ALOT of your time e.g. the grinding in this game. I'm not saying it's a bad thing to be a casual player as i love this game but because they keep releasing the new content before i can finish the old content they added (which i think a few have encountered) i find myself quite far behind in a sense after putting a handful of hours into this game.  My Final Opinion. I recommend this game as of now as this game is more for the dedicated players which isn't a bad thing. What i suggest they change is the amount of time it takes to grind for items as it'll help the game progression for players which don't have the sort of time like others.  Thank you for reading my review.   ",1,0

337000,Deus Ex: Mankind Divided™,"A great game that's over-stuffed with 'real world interactivity' and (optional) DLC microtransactions for both Single-player and Breach Mode is how I could describe it. I recommend if you can easily ignore the hidden Triangle codes hidden around the game and a very slightly (and better in ways?) worse UI.  I've spent around 3 hours in the 'Give Me Deus Ex' mode and here are my thoughts:   Gameplay : It's Human Revolution 2.0, which is exactly what I was hoping for. Human Revolution did an excellent job at taking what made Deus Ex fun and brought it up to a modern shooter style. So instead of completely ♥♥♥♥ing with it like Invisible War, they took what worked, improved the gunplay, changed some grievences with the old system like completely overstuffed inventories, and overall made it better. The new augments are awesome too, although are pretty much completely optional.  I knew that they were going to reset Adam's augmentations at some point (because how else would the game work if you were already completely decked out?), but i'm glad they found a plot point that made it work without looking stupid. I thought it was going to be something really stupid, or even a close repeat of HR, but for the most part it leaves questions in a good way.   Story : I can't say much about the story, but from what i've seen, it's really not as bad as RPS and the like make it out to be. Human Revolution was all about Jensen and what he has caused and done for the world and his motivations. If HR is about the character, then MD is about the world behind him. Jensen plays a bystander to the action by large in this game, only engaging deep in the thick of it when he feels he needs to, and that's fine.  I don't want another 'love interest, so therefore go through enemy compounds to get girlfriend, find out she's using you, wonder why you did it' story, because that's all HR was besides the Panchea incident. Overall, Deus Ex was never really about the story, so if you're looking for a deep engagement, just know that this game is more about Illumunati influence than Adam Jensen questioning his humanity, which he has already done in HR.  I will rewrite this some more or leave it by the time I finish the entire game.   Graphics/Performance : The graphics in this game are really fantastic compared to HR. It's still got the kind of 'everything shiny and bright' kind of style to it, but textures are greatly improved, the character models are very superb looking (except Sarif I would say), the contact shadow hardening on faces makes them look astounding, and the reflections and lighting are very nice. This is all on High settings w/o MSAA/TAA and 1080p.  My system is: MSI R9 380 4GB 980hz AMD FX-6300 OC@4.2Ghz 8GB RAM Windows 10 64-bit  I haven't ran an FPS counter, but compared to the little bit I played of the Xbox version, I'd say I run about 40-60 FPS with drops to ~35. It's completely playable for me and it USUALLY stays in the 50-60 range, but otherwise I don't ever really mind 30fps as long as it's stable. People seem to be really upset with anything less than 60 though, so if you're &gt;that&lt; worried about framerate, you should probably keep away until DirectX 12 or some optimization patches.",1,0

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"I like a lot of games, but I don't like Total War: Warhammer. I love it! The list of games that have impressed me this much is slim indeed but this game made the cut for me. It is optimized so much better than Attilla and I have not had any bugs or crashes as of yet. I see others have and that is unfortunate but I am past 10 hours on day 1 and I haven't had any issues.   You have out done yourself with the campaign. Each race feels so unique and different to play as both in battle and on the campaign map itself. The only things I could think of for cons in the campaign is no town/ village maps. Unless it has a wall you can't defend it. Which would have been worse but you do have a system for upgrading towns to have walls which is nice.  Other than that the campaign is amazing so far. It makes me want more factions though xD so yeah bring me the DLCs and I will gladly pay for these unique new races and factions that add to the game.   Oh I guess one other con is the multiplayer, it's the same options as Attila and Rome 2 with a couple options taken out like picking the weather.

307960,IL-2 Sturmovik: Battle of Stalingrad,"Written in December 2014, the game is in contant development and I expect it to be geting only better. *Year after this was written, I'm adding some comments to keep it up to date*  I wanted to start by saying it's unpolished gem, but it's not. It's a highly polished gem, fitted into cheap mass produced jevelry and wrapped in gift bag bough on discount last January. If you want realistic flying experience, don't miss it. If you want to treat yourself seriously as a simmer, you may find out-of-cockpit parts of game not dignified enough *Still mostly true, although quality of jewelry is much better*.  The good: The sim part (simulating planes and their enviroment) is very good - the game is great stick and rudder experience, the planes have mass and inertia, when flying them on the edge of flight envelope you feel them sliding from course, rather than being pushed to the side along set vector with randomized shaking added. The AI planes use the same physics as player, so they don't take breaks from reality and pretend they are jets when pressed to hard. Par the course, some people find flight models unrealistic or simply not what they expected. There are no clickable cockpits like in CloD or DCS, but after automated engine start you get to control most of plane systems (IMHO the biggest missing part is no manual fuel tank selection). To me it has the best feeling of 'being there' of all WW2 planes, but I'm stick and rudder fetishist, not clickable cockpit fetishist. There are no stability problems, unfinished plane systems of weird flight behaviour.  The bad: There are ten flyable plane types in the game (*Battle of Moscow will bring ten more, five already done, that BoS owners can meet in air even without owning BoM*). More are in the works, but because of sim part being detailed like I said above, making new planes is slow process. Do not expect to see tens of flyables soon, or variants of the same model (like all Bf-109F variants) made by small modifications of existing plane. There are *no* AI-only planes (one *has been made since review was written*) because, as they use realistic flight physics, they are not easy to make, either. You won't see tens upon tens of computer-controled planes in misisons, either, they are to CPU-hungry for that. The number of players in MP missions is limited (*much less now than year ago*) , devs still work on optimising support of more players in mission as I write. The single player part, or campaign, is something in between proper career from IL-2:1946 and mission generator - you pick stage of the battle, airfield you take off from, plane, mission type (intercept, escort, ground attack, bombing, close air support) and off you go. Missions are generated randomly with variety of weathers and targets, but they aren't as immersive as real career missions - maybe because you get no background on what your target is and why it's important beyond 'go and bomb that bridge'. There are difficulty settings in game, but in campaign you can use only two presets, normal (icons and automated engine management) and expert (realistic). Instead of adjusting realism settings before mission, you disable unrealistic aids in flight by key command (say, I bound a key that turns all engine helpers off and hit it at start of each mission, to fly with manual engine management but icons on). *The third party PWCG, a full blown career generator, is coming and already playable*.The mission editor is quite complicated so there isn't flood of user-made content and multiplayer servers - but what community made so far was of very good quality.   The ugly: The most hated part, which caused many people to give up the game as arcade: the plane modifications (bombs for fighters, bigger cannons, armoured windscreens etc) are unlockable - you get them by flying the plane in question in single player campaign. Most of these mods are non-standard, experimantal, or one-off modifications, but few are standard-issue systems that you can't accss from the start. *Owners of Premium edition - all 10 planes - can now disable the dreaded unlocks with one mouse click*. Also, the campaign includes game elements like experience and player 'level' (the higher it is, the more dangerous becomes opposition and flak fire in campaign. I suppose it is meant to make game easy for new sim players and progress as they succeed and learn). Then, you can start the mission in the air, half way towards the target, and abort it on reaxching 'exit' waypoint - takeoff and landing are optional - and on lower player levels thare is little action outside target area. So the first impression is that missions consist of going to action point, doing your job, going back. It's not the case, but you have to bother playing through simpler missions to make things more interesting. These are pointless additions to otherwise purebreed sim, and many people can't get past it - some play multiplayer only and don't want to play campaign at all, some call it pointless grinding, some are so experienced they want difficult missions from the start and give campign up as to easy before they rise their pilot level and get to difficult stuff. Make no mistake, once you sit in the cockpit you get a proper sim experience, and once you get your unlocks and rise level to get interesting missions you just have a good mission generator to play with forever, no limits - but the awards that are supposed to motivate players to play are something out of console game.  There are smaller bad decisions, like locking most of graphics options to four preset settings - you don't get to set manually drawing distance for objects or super sampling, you choose high, low, medium, ultra setting and that's it. You have manual control of resolution and antialiasing, though. It made some sense in development, but is pointless now * and has been made more workable with more options to customise your settings some time after review was written*.  All these are *were* pointless design decisions that nobody i know likes, but the developers stay by them *until they fixed them*. This stubborness earned them lot of enemity and made many people abandon the game *still true*, but I have to say dev team is very cooperative with community in most other respects, adding elements requested by players and listening to suggestions of flight model changes. There was some rush to release the game on deadline, so maybe they will replace it with something better once team catches they breath *they did*. Or not. *Or they add option to drive tanks*.",1,1

It does a good job of capturing the essence of the single player games, but the MMO-presence is also felt. I'm playing off-and-on with a friend, but the quests don't really meld us together and there's a bit of communication necessary to make sure we're on the same page. I feel that this should be addressed somewhat, but from a single-player perspective it's quite fun.

It really reminds me of Phantasy Star synth music (already bought the OST on bandcamp).

The graphics are beautiful, the sotry is amazing, and the end is left for you to decide, which was alittle frustrating at first, but as i'm writing this review, it defenatly feels like the right choice. Do yourself a favor and pick up this game, you won't regret it.  P.S. keep the turtle and take him on all your adventures :P",1,0

400,Portal,"Wow, what a game. Portal is one of those really brilliant games that comes along and takes everything with a storm. Portal is a 1st person puzzle game. You control a silent and unknown protagonist doomed to do puzzles over and over by an evil (and coolest) machine entity. The key features in the gameplay revolves around you solving puzzles using a gun shooting portals. This in itself may not sound that awesome, but you really have to experience the puzzles to percieve the cleverness (Is that even a word?) behind them. The gameplay has a natural difficulty curve with the game becoming harder and harder. It never feels annoying though, the hard part in this game is to figure out the puzzle. Usually you have a good amount of time to figure it out, and when you finally do, it feels very rewarding completing the darn thing. The graphics are nothing to call home about. They are descent. The very best thing in the game is by far the story. Considering all you do is solving puzzles, this may sound strange, but one key element changes this. The machine that has kept you trapped for 'Testing' is one of the best characters created in many years. The constant barrage of comments and sarcasm delivered with an amazing voice is just fantastic. Combine this with an atmosphere where you find yourself insignificant, lost and utterly alone gives a really unique gaming experience.",1,0

You'll never know because there is no kill cams here. Sometimes you have to play on the Europe servers because there are more players there then the US.

337000,Deus Ex: Mankind Divided™,"Deus Ex: HR was amazing in so many ways (even though it had a few small annoying flaws), so I kinda had the same expectations on Deus Ex: MD when I bought it.   Compared to HR, MD is a disappointment. Storywise there were no real surprises and it was too predictable. And technically it was frustrating with corrupt savefiles, no warning when you've used to many saves and suddenly you couldn't save and gamecrashes. And the space button when loading the game... you have to make sure that you dont save while taking cover or you'll jump out from cover when entering the game.   I still enjoyed the game and I do recommend it, but don't have to high expectations if you (like me) have been spoiled with HR. It's still a beautiful game, and the story (even though predictable) takes the game forward and of course, there is lots of achievements!  ---  EDIT: Been playing Breach for some hours now, and i can say im not impressed.

This game had me rubbing my face due to being overwhelmed so quickly. I must have started the learning scenario over about 10 times. At last after not giving up!!!! I'm taking over cities, castles, and churches! I'm plotting and killing anyone in the way of my Crown!! I'm crushing armies and claiming their lands!!!! What? You don't want to marry me? TOO BAD!

Following some what the events of F.E.A.R. 2 you can play as either the Point Man or Paxton Fettel, making for an interesting Co-Op experience compared to recent titles. The game play can be quite entertaining, however offering very little replay value. Also the story writing goes further down the trash bin, personally letting me down as I am a die hard fan of the original F.E.A.R. and admittedly enjoyed F.E.A.R. 2. However taking a thriller/shooter and casualizing the game play to CoD style truly took the games identity away. I have lost all hope of this game coming back to its original stature. Do NOT purchase this title, do not recommend. Also looking at the banners for each title should show how the quality was given up each title to where it stands today.",-1,0

Many upgrades for you to choose from and a selection of achievements for you to try and unlock. Also two unlockable characters and two endings.  I believe the game is worth the cost when it's on sale. With only 4 levels that you have to mix and match to defeat every last boss in, it gets kind of repetitive. That aside, I feel the game was well done and was enjoyable for the most part. I haven't 100% the game yet, but plan on to very soon. It's still fun to beat up all those zombies!

203160,Tomb Raider,"Let's get this out of the way, I've never played a single Tomb Raider game prior to this and I'm well aware from the reactions of fans that this game is very different and to some 'not accurate' to the spirit of the original Tomb Raider games. I'm not writing about that, I'm simply stating whether or not I enjoyed this game.   I did not.   Games like Tomb Raider, Ryse: Son of Rome, Order 1886 etc. represent a growing trend to make games look and feel like mainstream blockbuster films. The problem is this means gutting gameplay heavily for the sake of cinematic presentation, which is NOT the strength of an interactive art form. Tomb Raider flips back and forth so frequently between needless cinematic sequences and player control that it just became a frustrating chore to distinguish the 'QTE' cutscenes from the 'sit back, shut up, and enjoy the film' variety.   Whats more frustrating is the gameplay that is presented doesn't mesh well with the character development of this 'coming of age' Lara Croft story. 'Cutscene Lara' is constantly feeling overwhelmed by the catastrophic situations around her and spends a significant portion of the game struggling with having to kill people for her own survival. The problem is 'Gameplay Lara' doesn't reflect this, because after her first kill she turns into Marcus Fenix, with the player being rewarded for 'Killer Headshots!' For a game thats trying to present the grim reality of violence in the face of survival, it sure does take a light-hearted approach to killing hundreds of unknown humans who, just like Lara, are simply doing what they feel is necessary to stay alive.   The story itself is a pacing nightmare. Once the action starts it just keeps going to the point of exhaustion, and the few character moments that are presented tend to repeat the same beats of 'I can't do this!' followed by 'yes you can!' etc etc. In between those moments is just a constant slew of disasterous coincedences that make Amanda Ripley's adventure in space look like a casual sunday stroll.   Significant story points are also figured out by the player 4-6 chapters ahead of Lara, which results in the 'reveal' falling flat.   I could make positive remarks about the gunplay, but for a game released in 2013 should the phrase 'well the gunplay feels decent' really be all that is needed to recommend a game? Firearm gameplay is so rampant in the industry that it shouldn't be considered impressive for a developer to get it right. As stated before its also a mechanic that, while fun, conflicts with the story the studio was trying to present.  So no, I can't recommend this game. I hear 'Rise of the Tomb Raider' does address some of the issues of the first game, but for now I can't say this game presented itself well enough for me to consider purchasing the sequel.",-1,0

There is so much replayability with the random loot drops, the random universe generation, and also the different ship builds. The ship builds alone offer significantly different gameplay. You could use one ship that just shoots lasers rockets and pound the opponent into submission.

Then, about a week later, you will come back just to see if it really was that bad. You will start playing it, start to discover the game mechanics and the crafting system. Then you will continue playing it and eventually get addicted to it. Then your character will die. And you'll probably rage quit. But you'll come back the next day.  I mean, this game is awesome. For $10, you get a really nice product. You can even play multiplayer (wich I didn't try yet). I just love the way the game drops you inside the first biome and tells you nothing, almost laughing at you, it's kind of funny, but it makes discovering crafting recipes so much rewarding. The game is also very colorful, each biome having it's own main color. The perma-death system could look very frustrating at first (and it really is), but it adds a little bit more challenge to the game, wich pleases me, because it makes the game even more rewarding. The combat system is also really well done, because it takes skills not to get brutally murdered by every single creature you encounter.

310950,Street Fighter V,TL:DR - Only buy this for competitive play.     I play this as a PVP game and as such it is wonderful. I do not really care for PVE content but I will be happy once the Combo Trials are introduced.  The only real issue I have with SFV is that ragequitters are not punished and the match stats do not count as a win/loss for either side. This means that Alt-F4 after a KO is fairly common in ranked games.  The matchmaking has been fairly kind to me when compared to SFxTK and USFIV. I have had very few unplayable laggy games.  My Hori Real Arcade Pro V Hayabusa works flawlessly and the game inputs are as smooth as butter.  Once again I could not care less about the PVE aspects of the game so I will not comment on them.

The playerbase as dropped off so much, Rainbow, one of the most unique game modes, sometimes takes over 10 or more minutes to fill a single lobby. The devs seem to ignore the players to drop the ads.

Reason to that? The main reason to thumbs down this game  even beyond the bottom circle of the freaking hell and even further than our observable universe?  Yes you guessed it right: -The soul stealing, motivation draining and suicide supportive  community  of this  game  full of literal crybabies, trolls, quiters, and probably some of saltiest  buffalo ♥♥♥♥♥ talking ♥♥♥♥ even after getting roasted multiple times , served beside none of any common sense, sportsmanship or respect. Not every single player personally, but in fact, the wast majority of their 'target audition' honestly  don't deserve  to play at any single competitive or ranked branch even in any similar genre (football and racing included)  after a legit qualification or mandatory tutorial  that is actually demanding you  to ♥♥♥♥ing learn the ♥♥♥♥ing basics and strategies of the gameplay  (which is non-existent).  Conclusion: This game is in fact brilliant and really deserves its  2016 Game Developers Choice Award , but without anybody playing. I personally  nominate  the majority of its  community  for the  2016 Saltiest Aluminum Shitfull Trashcan Award   Notification for devs: It would be wonderful if you were to consider the actual functionality of your penalty/report systems that are currently not doing any equitable damage to quiters/offensives/trolls. Penalty for just rage quiting without any essential or emergent reasons are not punished well and those are continiously damaging the ones actually passionate about ranking up. About the offensiveness of behaviour and language, I actually think it should   truly and directly  effect ones rank and earned success by having confirmed reports of offensiveness leading to penalties such as instant demotion or temporary/permanent muting alongside with a tag indicating what one have done wrong/inappropriate. Both possibilities, in my oppinion, are enough to reduce a solid amount of saltiness.  I only tried to play this game so hard because it is literally the only piece of its football/racing(sort of) combined genre.",-1,1

9880,Champions Online,"I've only started this game when it first went F2P at the beginning of this year (before it came to Steam), and I have to admit that I’m always a little wary of trying out MMOs. They are addicting and consume much more of my time than I would like to admit. The greatest thing about ‘Champions’ is the amount of customization that you can do for your character. Obviously, there are the powers, but the selection of choosing how your character looks like is phenomenal. I’ve never seen such a system that lets you adjust so many aspects of your hero. It’s worth a try, even if it’s just because you like to design and tweak your avatars down to the very last detail. It’s a great superhero MMO and I got quite a bit of fun out of it. The art style is quite unique and it really does have that comic book feel. I would definitely play more if I had more free time.",1,0

304730,Train Fever,"I recommend it only because I believe with work, it could be good. Here's the thing with this game, it doesn't really tell you how to make money. It only tells you how to create bus stations and train stations. So you create them, and within 10 minutes, you fall into debt. I have no idea how you're supposed to maintain a decent transportation business when none of the industries use your lines to transport goods. Not to mention, it plays a lot like a sandbox, so shouldn't we have the freedom to do as we choose? Nope! Not here! You can borrow a few million, but then you're capped out. So even if you just wanna build a whole bunch of stuff and watch time go by, you can't.  Welcome to Train ♥♥♥♥in' Fever!",1,1

278360,A Story About My Uncle,"This was a really short game. I beat the game in roughly two and a half hours so if you are expecting a game that will last a long time, this isn't the game for you. It was fun and the grappling mechanic made for a different—and to me new—sort of platformer, but as fun as the gameplay was it wasn't long enough to justify paying the full price for the game. I got it as part of the Humble Bundle which I think was a great deal. The story is a little weird, but this is not a game to play for the story, this is again all about the gameplay.",1,0

219740,Don't Starve,"This game's art style is really what caught my eye in the first place, so I thought I would buy it whenever it went on sale.   Basically this is a game of survival and there are many things that can kill you. Your character is thrown into a world of vast wilderness and left to fend for himself/herself. Each world is randomly arranged and have random spawnings, keeping the game pretty fresh and new. You gather natural materials like sticks and rocks, make tools like axes and shovels, make traps or weapons to catch animals for food, set up campfires for survival, etc.  In the game you have three things you want to keep in check when surviving: Health, Hunger, and Sanity. If you lose your health, well, you can die. If you lose your hunger, you lose your health and die. If you lose your sanity, you start seeing things. Eventually your hallucinations become violent when you're insane and can hurt you. You can also unlock different and unique characters depending on in-game events or accomplishments.   The art style of this game in my opinion, is very unique and eye-catching. The game is very smooth and doesn't lag alot in general. (depending on how your computer is running though.) It does crash sometimes though. (I've had it crash twice on me.) I have also found a few glitches in the game (before Reign of Giants.)   This game gives you alot of chores for survival to keep you occupied, though sometimes it does get repeative. The worlds in Maxwell's Gate are the true challenges, whether its going through endless winters or rain. Or even hunted by hounds. Every world is filled with multiple monsters and critters to kill or survive from. There are also tons of material to collect for tons of creations you can unlock and survive with, giving this game some variety if you get that far. I really love the different characters in this game too, each one having their own charms and personalities. (My favorite character is Webber.) At times I get alot of creepy vibes from this game, especially at night when my sanity is getting low. And accomplished vibes whenever I survive from stuff.   This game does have its charms, but it also has its fair share of flaws. Some of the flaws with this game is the repetiveness when trying to survive multiple times. Dying is definitely a big disappointment, especially when you get pretty far. This was not meant to be a very easy game though. The farther you get, the harder it gets. I would also say that some of the music (mostly in reign of giants) is a little too...cheesy, in a way? (I suppose its meant to be like that but still,) And some of the character's voices (which are instrument sounds) get a little annoying at times. Like Wilson's, for example, and when he gets hurt. The things they say give them alot of personality though. Especially Wendy. One more thing, sometimes (especially when you're a newbie) you encounter things that you have no idea how to deal with unless you look it up. (Which I suggest doing research before eating any of those colorful mushrooms unless you want to do it yourself.)   One last thing I have to say about this game is this: It's not for everyone. Some people (like me) will really like this game, and others might think its as boring as heck, everyone has their own tastes. So, if you're interested in it, I suggest checking this game out and maybe watch other people play it. Its a very fun game and can get time-consuming, I'd say its worth a buy. 8/10.  Another thing: Multiplayer is comming soon! :D",1,0
225080,Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons,"This was a beautiful game, I can't sum it up any better than that without giving too much away. The puzzles were fairly easy, the game play however was unique.

The game really made you feel for the main character (can't remember his name unfortunately and I've already deleted this game from my steam so I can't replay to get his name haha) and really makes you think about life in general. This and paired by the game's title Carpe Diem ('Seize the day') really gives you chills.   If there was a sequel to this game, I would definitely play the game.   ",1,0

203810,Dear Esther,"I got this game because I had heard complaints that it was more of an interactive novel than a game. That kind of thing is right up my alley - it's the story I'm interested in. I had also seen some of the beautiful screen shots, and was eager to explore this little world.  I was disappointed by both the story and the exploration. The world is, indeed, beautiful, and there are details like crushed cigarette packages on the ground and flowers waving in the breeze. The problem is that there isn't much more to it than what you can see in the trailer. After you've had a good look at the shack by the lighthouse and its surroundings, there's nothing new to see until you get to the caves. The caves are gorgeous, but again, once you've seen the first one, they all look more or less the same.   And there is no real exploration. You really are just playing a story, and the railroad tracks are firmly installed. Now and then it might appear that you have a choice to make, but you don't. There's always only one way you can go - split paths always quickly meet back up again.  The narrative is very poetic, often beautiful, sometimes touching. But there just isn't very much of it. The game description claims the audio, visuals, and 'events' (not sure what events they refer to) are randomly generated, but I played through twice and they didn't seem to be. There was some slight variation in the order that you hear the various fragments of text, but not enough that I'd call it 'random.' Once you've played it through once, which takes about an hour, maybe 90 minutes if you really take your time and poke around a lot, there's not much of any reason to play through again. It seems meant to convey a feeling about a singular event more than to tell an actual story, and that only really works the first time through. Once you understand what's happening, it loses most of its emotional effect. I suppose if you have some personal connection to the event in question, it might be more significant, but I think most people will find it a bit too distant to have a lasting effect.  Overall, the game is not *bad*, it's just lacking. If you want to spend an hour or so wandering through an eerie environment, listening to poetic voiceovers, then it's just fine. But don't expect any more than that, because that's all there is, really.  If you can get the game at a big discount, or as a gift from someone, then it might be worth a play through. The price tag of 7 euros, however, seems awfully high for such a small amount of content.",-1,0

351910,Valhalla Hills,"I am currently finding this game very enjoyable. It still has a few bugs to squash (then again what game doesn't) but Funatics seem activly involved on the forums so that is a very good and welcome sign.  The game play is simple enough not to put you off, yet complex enough to keep you interested. None of the levels have been overly complicated so far, however I am not that far in and it is getting progressivly more difficult.  The 'Normal' mode trains you how to play the game, progressivly unlocking items as you go along so as not to overwhelm you. There is a sandbox type mode that has everything already unlocked but if you don't have a good grip on the game yet this mode should be avoided to start, unless you like pain, confusion, and rage quiting.  Graphics wise the game does enough to look good (built on UE4) but doesn't have any un-needed fluff or eye-candy, which can be seen as a good or bad thing.  Overall I'm excited to see what this game still has in store and what updates are just around the corner.  If you like settlers, ANNO, Tropico, Cultures, and games of that nature this is right up your alley. If not there isn't much in this one that will entice you to keep playing.",1,0

268500,XCOM 2,"Not sure why everyone is hating on this game so much, it is Xcom. No more, no less. You are the underdog in this game, fighting back against the alien overlords. Yes missions have timed objectives but if you plan ahead and think strategically you will have more than enough time to take care of the objective while also keeping your troops alive. People complaining about sectoids make me shake my head. Not only do they waste their turns doing psi abilities like reanimating or mind controlling, most of the time they would be more dangerous if they would just shoot at your troops, but anyone packing a flashbang can straight up hard counter the sectoid. A lot of people are complaining about the timed missions, you are usually given 7-15 turns before the objective is lost, but not having time limits would make no sense not to mention it was something that made Xcom EU so completely easy.   TLDR; This is an xcom game, people who are complaining are the same people who want a easy game where it holds your hand through the whole thing.",1,0
337000,Deus Ex: Mankind Divided™,"This is a quick preliminary review after just under 6 hours of play. This is Deus Ex; closest to the original I've seen yet. So far, this game actually has the same feel as the original. As much as I liked Human Revolution, it wasn't able to quite achieve that.  Cons:  Yes, Square is unabashedly making a money grab with the store. But in no way does it impact the game, nothing is available to you exclusively through the store. It's really not a big deal. Only downside is that the preorder items are treated like store purchases, so you won't be able to use them on a second playthrough. Lipsyncing is a little off, and occassionally the enemies are a little jerky, which can make combat feel a bit... twitchy at times. Software takes up inventory space. Uh, in a cyborg? Yes, mouse sensitivity is jacked up to 11. Turn it down in the options. Another tip mentioned in a guide is that turning it to 0% effectively turns off mouse accelerations, suggesting it might have been better labeled in the settings.  Pros: So far the characters are well written and presented. Prague feels fairly open and there is definitely plenty of flexibility in how you approach things. As it should be with Deus Ex, you get a lot more of the story if you take the time to read things. A lot is true to the original game. I found myself cursing not being able to carry every gun around - even after upgrading my inventory - but then remembered that choosing what to carry with you is a standard trope of the series. If you're wondering, stealth is totally a viable option. And the game is quite pretty to look at.  Ugly: Edit: Have to say the interface - it's clunky. While better than many other ports, it's obvious the interface was built around consoles. You have to reach for the Esc key way too often to navigate menus - and sometimes (depending on context) instead of backing out it just jumps to the menu screen. I'd recommend mapping Esc to a spare mouse button if you have one. Might have made sense to actually use RMB to back out of menus, since I believe it is only used for ironsights. Long-pressing the Y key to bring up the weapon menu is another example - no reason long-pressing should be necessary on a keyboard. As a final example, you should be able to mouse over an item in your inventory to see what it is, but instead you have to click on it which brings up a menu and blocks many other items.  Anything that involves item manipulation (throwing, grabbing and moving) is overexagerrated. Trying to stack objects to reach a vent is a pain when each item want to slide all over the place. Throwing an item can send it ricocheting off walls. Why is this not listed under cons? Because it feels exactly like the original Deus Ex.  The really ugly: the ridiculous number of people that are not recommending this game because of one issue (the one issue varies by individual) is absolutely absurd. Also, take the comments about terrible performance with a pile of salt. I've seen very few AAA titles truly optimized at launch. If you expect all the drivers to work perfectly and no need for patching on launch day... go fire up your console. If you're running a 970 or 980, be sure to adjust your settings as widely recommended (disable MSAA and turn volumetric and contact hardening shadows to On instead of Ultra). As to people reporting 30-40 fps on GTX 1080 SLI or other such beastly rig: They likely need to adjust something (game settings, drivers, OS, etc.).  Yesterday I took my aging rig (i7-3820, ROG Formula X79 MB, 16GB) and replaced 680 SLI with a new MSI Gaming GTX 1070. I also went ahead and updated to the latest Win 10 Anniversary patch and updated all my drivers. I am using the default OC mode in the MSI app (not manually OCing). At 1080p, no MSAA, volumetric and contact shadows to On, and everything else using the Ultra settings, I am getting 100fps and my GPU temp isn't even clearing 70°. Not even close to stressing this card, and everything is running great.  I have heard that Afterburner sometimes misreports GPU memory usage, but for those running older cards I will mention that my numbers are showing the game using 6GB of VRAM. If accurate, that might explain why some are having issues.",1,1
242050,Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag,"A Pirates life for me...  The Assassin’s Creed series hasn’t changed much since it’s Holy-War debut back in 2007.  Ubisofts signature blend of parkour/stealth gameplay, framed by a compelling and often Kojima-esque meta-narrative is a formula which has never needed much improvement. But each addition to the series has built on its predecessor, adding interesting new mechanics and hooks (I’m looking at you, Revelations) to help keep things fresh.   Black Flag places you in the recently liberated boots of Captain Edward Kenway; a rough round the edges, loveable rogue with a quick wit and one thing on his mind. Treasure. And whist Templar conspiracies and secret wars with assassins are rife in the vast Caribbean ocean, Kenway’s only interested in such affairs for as long as they're profitable. To that end, Black Flag positively encourages exploration and adventure to the point where the main story quickly becomes a secondary concern. Which isn’t to say it’s not worth playing through. In fact, Black Flag’s main narrative is arguably one of the strongest in the franchise. The overall tone is light and humorous (certainly in comparison to the sombre, quest-for-revenge that was ACIII), and there’s not a single character amongst the myriad cast of famous-named swashbucklers that doesn’t feel fleshed-out and well characterised.  The game also offers an overwhelming number of side activities to indulge in and keep you occupied. Many we’ve already seen in previous ‘Creeds’, but some welcome, themed additions to the roster include whaling, diving, hunting for Mayan treasure and battling with the Caribbean’s 4 ‘Legendary’ enemy ships. But trust me when I say leave fighting them until your endgame.   The huge world map is revealed incrementally as you travel from island to island, and large sections are filled in with the successful takeovers of heavily guarded forts. These effectively act as synchronisation points for the overworld map; highlighting nearby towns, islands and explorable shipwrecks, as well as a plethora of other pirate collectables. And it’s well worth taking to time to collect them. Building materials and plans are needed to upgrade and customise the Jackdaw. And you’ll need plenty of Reyals to kit Kenway out with new gear if you want to stand a chance late in the game.  You’ll soon find however, that some of Black Flags most enjoyable moments come from travelling between the Caribbean’s various points of interest. Naval combat has been refined and perfected from its role as a side-quest in ACIII, and now features the ability to board and takeover enemy ships.  The feeling of broadsiding a British man-o-war in the middle of a typhoon, before swinging onto the deck and wreaking havoc with a bandolier full of flintlocks, is one that’s seriously hard to beat. Throw in a heroic, Hollywood-esque score (composed by Iron Man 3s, Brian Tyler), and you’ve got an experience as close to being in a Pirates of the Caribbean film as you could ever hope for.  Even out of combat; the sounds of the ocean, distant cannon-fire and sea-shanties chorused by the Jackdaw’s crew, make for a scenic and atmospheric ride. Although your ships ability to magically vacuum up any floating loot and sailors that drift by, does little for the immersion. Of course, the games various glitches and bugs don’t help much either. All too often your high-profile free-run controls will send you jumping sideways onto a path you didn’t necessarily want to go down, and A.I musketeers have an unerring ability to hit you even when you’re behind cover. But these are minor issues in an engine that’s otherwise seriously impressive.   In short, Assassin’s creed Black Flag is a tremendous technical achievement and arguably the best in the series to date. Stunning visuals, impressive sound design and fast-paced, free-flow combat make for an engaging and immersive experience. Upgrading the Jackdaw and Kenway, adds a satisfying RPG element and there’s some excellent scope for customisation. The story is well paced and quick to get going, although certain mission types soon start to feel repetitive. But if and when you get bored, there’s always something else to do. Whether that’s hunting elusive white whales to craft Kenways next costume, or trying to unearth buried treasure with only a hand-scrawled map for direction; the important thing is that you have the freedom to choose. And surely that’s what being pirates all about.  Well… that and treasure.  Yo Ho!",1,0

246900,Viscera Cleanup Detail,"Clearly I'm not the only one who, whilst killing space marines in an off-earth mining facility as an insectoid alien, wondered who was going to clean up the mess. With this game, it's you. Move over, space marines, and let the space janitor through.  It's a strange game, for sure. The gameplay and atmosphere remind me a bit of Portal, and vaguely of Surgeon Simulator. The game is exactly what it says on the tin- you run around with a mop and bucket, cleaning up after various sci-fi disasters. The goal is to take the warzone and make it good as new by mopping up and incinerating all evidence, and tidying up what's left. It can be somewhat repetitive and sometimes frustrating, but it's more about the big picture than instant gratification, and various levels do come with their own unique challenges. Overall, it's great zen game for obsessive compulsives like me who get a huge sense of satisfaction from setting things right. I'm very much enjoying myself.  Unfortunately, it does make me motion sick, so if you're prone to motion sickness like I am, maybe just be aware of that. It does give you the option of changing the FOV, though, which goes a long way to improving the experience!",1,1

Most of my time spent in this game was with a Game of Thrones mod, since without the absurd amount of DLC, the number of kingdoms/duchies/etc. I could play as was extremely limited.  The DLC. Right, so there look to be about 40 DLCs which, in total, normally cost 160 USD. This is outrageous! If I paid 40 USD for the game to begin with, I would expect a full game. But no, Paradox seems to be on the path of pushing out half-finished games with full price tags and the expection of producing content later for an extra cost. It's really starting to wear on me now that EU IV is doing the same. I just hate feeling nickel-and-dimed for content I expected to have.  What is there is good, I can't deny that. The problem for me is what isn't there, which, unfortunately, is a lot.",-1,1

377160,Fallout 4,"more skyrim than new vegas.  dialogue menus are worse in this iteration. most menus in general seem worse actually.  map appears to be smaller than both fallout 3 and new vegas.  some obvious bugs which will hopefully get patched, but this is obviously a console port.  skyrim-esque loading screens are annoying also.  pipboy interface isn't as good as previous games.  soundtrack is inferior, to this point (i'm like level 12 or something and only just hit diamond city) to previous fallout games.  companions are similarly annoying in this game, they get in your way when entering/leaving rooms etc.  leveling system is significantly worse than new vegas or fallout 3.  building a base seems fun, until you realize how much of a chore it is.  all that said, it's still fallout. hopefully patches are released and dlc will add/fix some of the issues i've addressed here.   if i have to rate it, for now, i'd give it about 7.5/10.",1,0

49540,Aliens: Colonial Marines,"Game over, man !  Now I have played through the entire game, time has come to review this masterwork of strategic AI and cooperative teamplay.  The venerable O'Neil, loyal companion and compatriot, whose aim is always true, yet seems to find the right place to stand. A valuable ally in the fight against xenomorph infestation.  As always, the space marines show both intelligence and courage, strategic positioning, never running forward into the open when a choke position could be formed, and most importantly of all : they are careful when using explosive ordinance. A true credit to their training, for who except the most exceptionally bright and talented would volunteer to be blasted into space while inside a version 2 fridge-freezer with the chance thereafter to run around with a machine gun inside a metal cylinder where any hole to the vacuum of space would spell certain doom for those inside. Hoo-ra.  The enemy roster includes the standard fare of aliens, queens, and corporate evil-doers. Weyland-Utani corporation, the main antagonist in this game, NOT the titular aliens as one might expect seems not to be compliant with the Health and Safety at Work act. Shame on them. Best thing for any space marine to do would be to destroy the cells powering what limited safety equipment does exist. That will teach them to be compliant.  In conclusion this game is certainly worth at least £3 for the 8-hour or so campaign and as such has my recommendation.",1,0
272600,Detective Grimoire,"It's a tiny and very easy game, but an enjoyable one. The puzzles are super simple, so if you are an adult, and used to adventure games, don't expect a challenge! The game has other great qualities. It has an intriguing story and quirky characters, the atmosphere and music are great, the voice acting is well done and fits into the game, and the graphics are really nice.  However, this game took me less than two hours to finish, and I don't think that anyone would need more than 4-5 hours tops, so the price is much too high. Wait for a sale or a bundle!

33460,From Dust,"Very innovative game. The nature effects, such as the crashing of waves on the shore, flow of water down a natural river, and flowing lava are amazing. The story mode is challenging and requires you to spend extra time on the map to fully unlock all the story/challenge 'memories'. Sadly, this suffers from bad console port syndrome, as there are some graphical anomolies, sound weirdness, cutscenes abruptly ending, and some control weirdness. The game is still very playable and lots of fun. I would've liked to see a sandbox mode, where you can start with a blank slate and just start building your own land mass and/or make your own maps to challenge friends. Definitely worth the price point. I estimate the game story mode takes about 4-5 hours to complete.",1,0

208580,STAR WARS™ Knights of the Old Republic™ II: The Sith Lords™,"Knights of the Old Republic has not aged well at all. The environments are left empty and feel 'small.' The menus are unintuitive and really show their age. PC port-over seems fairly lazy and the game would be better played on a controller. The dialogue detracts from any progress made from a good story so you're left annoyingly trotting around an unfamiliar world with little to detract from how old the game is. Even for a die-hard Star Wars fan, it was hard to trudge through.  The second installment did next to nothing to change the game. A different story seems to be all it can boast.",-1,0

It's not really pay 2 win, but unlocking things takes quite a long time (100-300 currency per match, while new characters cost 50000 currency and loadouts around 7500 or something like that) which is pretty rough and I hope will eventually change, but probably won't )=",1,0

310470,Grand Ages: Medieval,"This game is right up my alley. Keeps me thinking and easy to get lost in....once you get the hang of it. It took me at least 4 starts to be able to get things off the ground somewhat efficiently. It takes time, a lot of time, to do things well in this game and keep pace witht the pc. That's how I want it, but it can be discouraging at times. It's got it's minor issues and things I want adjust but that goes for pretty much any strategy game out there. They said they haven't encrypted anything so it's possible to be modded and I do look forward to people tweaking a few settings, early game is rough once a military becomes necessary. Even so I've finally gotten a good game rolling and am loving the challenge of this game. Finally taken over a few towns, and more or less keeping pace with the PC factions who grow rapidly even on normal.   Some may find combat a little underwhelming. It is pretty simple compared to the trading system. It basically always comes down to who has the better economy as battles can go on for years as you cycle troops in and out while trying not to go broke and expand at the same time. Honestly there's so much going on with the economy and expanding that you don't need to get dragged into the finer details of combat. I do wish there was more feedback for what is going on with the battles, That can actually be said for lots of things in the game. I'd really like more infomation on mouse over of many values because it can be really hard to figure out the breakdown of variables going into them.   Is the game perfect, of course not, but I'm finding it really complex and entertaining, even if I did spend hours getting my ♥♥♥ handed to me.",1,1

It even informs me that it's already running if I try to open it again without ending the task.  Like I said, I love this game.

238210,System Shock 2,"This is an AMAZING game with a story that is vast and honestly more than I expected out of a 1999 video game. I had read that this game is the spiritual predecessor to Bioshock, and I can definately see resemblances here and there. It has a sort of RPG element, where you can raise your stats, weapon abilities, psionic powers, and skills such as hacking. There are no levels per se, but sections that you slowly gain access to.  About the only faults I can say about the game is that towards the end, there is a lot of back-and-forth travelling you need to do, it's not always clear where you're supposed to go, and I did run into some slightly bad AI at times. It is an old game, so graphics might also be on the list of faults, but I honestly didn't care about the slightly improved 1999 look.  Again, the story is amazing, it'll last you a long time if you look around like I did, and the environment was interesting. I only wish they'd remake the game with today's technology!",1,0

378720,Thea: The Awakening,"Thea: The Awakening is an indie 4X game developed by Muha Games. For the unfamiliar, 4X games stand for Explore, Expand, Exploit, and Exterminate, similar to the famous Civilization series.   Gameplay revolves around developing a single outpost by exploring the surrounding areas, collecting resources, and crafting items and equipment based upon what is available to you. The 3 primary character classes: Harvester, Warrior, and Craftsman make up the trinity of the explore, harvest, build cycle that fuels the expansion of your infrastructure and power.  Combat is card based (each character is a card), and the uses of each card depend on the characters abilities. There are many ways to engage an enemy in combat; if your exploring group is weak but has strong gathering abilities you can engage in a hunting challenge instead. These alternative fighting methods are preferable because characters can only die or suffer wounds in direct combat. Death is VERY punishing, on higher difficulties with 'Realism' (no duplicate buildings) it is difficult to acquire more characters, losing harvesters or craftsman can be a huge setback.   And you will have setbacks. Thea introduces a system of random events that make each game a fresh experience. The random events are typically problems or encounters, where the player must select choices based upon the abilities of their characters. An example: a group of robbers confronts you, you can try to manipulate them through a social debate, fight them head on, or bribe them off with food and equipment. Choosing incorrectly in a higher stakes event can mean the end of your run.  This brings me to one of my favorite aspects of Thea: the level of challenge and adjustable difficulty. Nearly every aspect of game difficulty can be modified when a new game is created, anything from number of starting villagers, the difficulty of challenges, or the rate at which enemies grow stronger can be scaled from novice to expert level. Thea is a hard game in that it's easy to make mistakes that get your people killed and cripple your production, but the benefit is that you will see your progress as you improve your ability to avoid risks and adapt to what game situations you are given.  Thea: The Awakening is an enjoyable indie game and a bargain even at full price. The developers are still very active in updating the game and responding on the forums, I look forward to what else Muha will bring us. ",1,1

223710,Cry of Fear,"Great game with a lot of problems. It's basically just elements from other survival horror games all rolled into one, but it doesn't really mix them all seamlessly. Also the main portion of the game is a fetch quest where you're going back and forth between large areas looking for a couple of items.  Inventory management is very strict as well so you often have to drop very useful items just to keep the game progressing. I also wonder if the voice acting is bad on purpose?  As a horror game it excels. Atmosphere, sound, design, everything looks and plays great but it's just very unfufilled in terms of gameplay. This is a free mod developed by a small team so you've got to give it credit for that, but just don't believe all the hype, this is a game with a lot of issues.

228880,Ashes of the Singularity: Classic,"I love RTS games. I have played all games in each of these series: starcraft, warcraft, command and conquer, supreme commander, planetary annihilation, sins of a solar empire.  This game feels the closest to supreme commander with less building. Strategic zoom is sort of there but not like supreme commander you don't get the strategic icons when zoomed out all the way which you can't fully zoom out. At first it feels like there are very few bulidings so its closer to games like command and conquer, &amp; warcraft.   I got the game after the single player was redone and apparently it sucked at launch. I am happy to say I enjoyed the single player aspect so far. I have 2 more missions left to complete and I bet it will get a good 10-15 hours out of most players. It gets much harder near the end which is nice. Some of them I had to redo multiple times just to get an optimal strategy because its a race against the clock.   Only played a few maps vs ai and it looks like lots of options there so thats good. I do like how this game promotes offensive play with the node resources connected so you can't just turtle to win.  Overall I recommend the game however I had to pickup a GTX 1070 just to play the game more than 20 fps. Now I get 60 so thats nice. My PC is 4 years old so keep that in mind you will probably want a really good graphics card and fairly recent PC components.",1,0

282140,SOMA,"PROS +Amazing story. I don't think I've ever played a horror game where the plot is so relevant and poses such amazing questions to the player. I can't really say much about this for the sake of keeping this review spoiler-free, but trust me when I say that it's a really, REALLY breathtaking experience. +Atmosphere. Even when you're relatively safe, the ominous depths of the oceans, the claustrophobic corridors of the underwater station you're in and the creepy background noises will keep you anxious. This game does a great job at being scary even when there is probably no real threat at that given point. Plus, the whole location is really frightening and... alien (no foreshadowing intended). +The actual horror. This is the least scary Frictional game so far (though that's highly debatable in my opinion), but that doesn't mean it'll go easy on you. Apart from the terrorizing and oppressive atmosphere, you will find a good amount of monsters and other threats that will make you jump from your chair or cry in horror. +Graphics. They're not top notch per se, but lightning and post-processing do an awesome job at increasing the game's immersion and haunting beauty.  CONS -Padding. Sometimes I just felt bored by the overly long fetch-quests or complicated puzzles the game tasked me with. Ok, the puzzles are not that hard. I just suck at puzzles. Yet, there are moments in the game i felt would have a bigger impact if they were shorter. This game has a decent length (about 10 hours with some much needed exploration), but I feel shortening some sections would have been better. -Exploration vs. monsters. This game has a truly astonishing lore, which deserves to be fully explored. There are lots and lots of text, audio and documents scattered around the maps, but it's quite hard to read them carefully when a freaking monster is shambling next to you. No wonder one of the highest rated mods on the Workshop is a 'pacifist' mod that renders all enemies peaceful (although they will still react to noise and follow you, creeping the crap out of you). I suggest you play the game the intended way, then play it again with that mod activated, in order to have an easier time fully understanding the background. -Lag. A truckload of lag, mostly because (i don't know if it's my system, but having an i7 4770k @3.50 GHz, a GTX 970 gpu and 16 GB of RAM, it's safe to say it's probably not) the game struggles to load new areas. Egregious examples are the transitions from open waters to the inside of the facility, but there are other occasions as well. It's not game breaking, but it's there and it's annoying.  SUMMARY You liked previous games by Frictional? Buy this, personally I think it's their masterpiece. You like horror games? This will give you the scares you want. You like good plot? This one's amazing, buy this freaking game right now. The only reasons not to buy SOMA are a)you're more of an action game guy or b)you don't like scary games. That's basically it. BUY IT DAMMIT!",1,0

Controls/keys seem a bit off with switching weapons and plasmids but they seem to fix that in Bioshock 2 with an almost entire key remapping. Also the mouse sensitivity will throw you off if you have a mouse that only goes up/down in increments of 400/500 unless you have a mouse in which you can custom-set your own personal DPI in as little as increments of 1 or 10.

12150,Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne,"Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne is a direct sequel to Remedy Entertainment's critically acclaimed 2001 third-person shooter Max Payne and picks up after the events of its predecessor. The game could be best described as noir-style love story, in contrast to the first that was more of a film noir revenge tale.  NYPD detective Max Payne is once again the primary protagonist, although a few very interesting segments sees you play as his love interest, Mona Sax. Max Payne 2 borrows a lot from the original and there are enough hints and references to the previous game which helps keep the narrative interesting and fresh for old-timers.  Max Payne 2 is, in many ways, a huge improvement over Max Payne 1. Gone is that constipated look replaced instead with full 3-D modeled faces. The game also sees an immense graphical upgrade with excellent usage of the Havok 2.0 physics engine. Game characters are more detailed while environment objects, including enemies, tumble and fall very realistically.  Gameplay is largely the same with a few refinements to combat. Bullet Time sees an upgrade allowing you to dodge bullets and reload quickly, with a cool whirling animation to go alongside it. This results in a higher body count but also makes gun-play segments a whole lot less challenging. Level designs are, once again, brilliant with mission locales ranging from warehouses, mansions, hospitals and clubs to constructions sites. And the enemy AI is, on a whole, pretty decent although in a few instances they end up killing themselves with their own grenade.   The plot is riveting with almost non-stop action throughout. The storyline unfolds in much the same fashion as the original. The usage of graphic novel comics complete with melodramatic over-the-top dialogue sucks you into the game's environment. If anything, the writing is more polished this time around with lots of witty and philosophical quotes thrown into the mix. The story focuses too much upon the love-story angle though which tends to get a bit jarring towards the end. In comparison, the original Max Payne's story, although slightly rough around the edges, was more dark, grittier and compelling than its sequel.   For a game that is over twelve years old, Max Payne 2 still holds remarkably well today. It overshadows the original in many aspects while also introducing a few cool mechanics of its own. Simplified mechanics make for interesting combat segments making Max Payne 2 one of the very best third-person shooters ever made.",1,1

This still looks really nice when leaving for missions but it can make it harder to see in darker parts. Also try to max out your resolution.  Play how its meant to be played - You should really do the side missions to get the most out of SW2, the game even asks to clarify if youre finished with them and are ready to progress.   I don't recommend lower difficulties - Either play on Insane or Hard. Insane (even hard) could be quite overwelming at first but if you take your time to understand undemanding mechanics aswell as specing your gems effectively it'll soon come a breeze.   Dont dig too deep away from the main path - Lets be real here, everyone has that curiousity to explore, but there arent any hidden game changers. You'll find more freshness with following the quest markers and spending LESS time exploring. There are some easter eggs, and secrets which are pointless to find unless you want the achievements. At best you can Vs level bosses for a unique weapon. All this can help you come around to another play through.  Can't see why any FPS/Doom player would'nt enjoy",1,0

If you go to the original and look for the options even though the game is not quite optimized it does have a very extensive graphic options.   For now just don't even bother, as a fan of this franchise I'll have to say go for the original game played it, if you can and when they fix this IF they fix this problems then come back and see what the community thinks of it after the fix, investigate and if everything is good go for it.

It's literally a DOSBOX port of the game, The music audio is so loud that it will over power everything else in the game and deafen you even if you turn the game down to almost nothing. The controls need to be reconfigured before you can play and then sometimes the keys just get stuck and you'll be walking forward continuously.   It saddens me as this is a great game but because of it's outdated control's and windowing issues and ear bleedingly loud audio makes it impossible to enjoy. Truely a waste.   This version of the game provides all the episodes but it's not reworked like Duke Nukem Megaton edition or Shadow warrior Redux, it's the barebones 1990's version before WASD was a thing and Mouse aiming wasn't a thought in anyones mind. It's just barely playable and it's more so like being tortured than having fun.   It would be nice if who ever published this asked the team that did Shadow Warrior Redux to rework this game to run with out DOSBOX and fixed some of the frustrating and cumbersome issues that come along with it.   I get it, It's 'Old School' but Duke and Shadow Warrior are old school as well and got Modern control and minor graphical upgrades to make those games look pleasent and run and control as they should. Sad to say This is one to avoid until someone does a decent update to this game so it can run properly and isn't just a DOSBOX port.

492220,Bohemian Killing,"TL;DR version:  - Not many games handle you control over a murderer who is making a testimony. Having to piece a story while adhering to the evidence collected by the authorities is a very nice twist on the usual take on the game of deduction. Huge plus for that.  - Being able to be wrong while piecing a story is refreshing. Too few games let you mess up. I can recall only two or three other games in the same genre that allow you to screw up.  - More than one possible outcome and story combination, so there is quite a bit of freedom when making up your story.  - I like the accents, it does suit the location of the story too.  - Having the Judge appear during more important testimonies, asking you questions directly on the scene, is really neat feature. I mean, it feels unreal (in a positive way) and helps the narrative side of the game. I really liked that.  - Evidence files were very well done. The font, the visuals...   The actual review:  Bohemian Killing is a detective game in reverse.   You are the murderer. You got caught.   In traditional detective games you have to find pieces of the puzzle and fit them together to solve a mystery. In Bohemian Killing you are given all evidence gathered by the police at beginning of the game. With it in hand you have to make your testimony at the court - coming up with a believable explanation of what has happened.   But to make your story believable you must ensure it fits the facts: time, place and action. This is where Bohemian Killing turns into an adventure game. You present your testimony by walking places and performing certain actions. Sometimes the Judge will ask you a few questions, during such moments the game will 'frezee' and screen will turn into black and white until the Judge gets his answers and the story resumes.   Bohemian Killing has a very interesting take on what you are doing: you don't create events. You are making UP a story (or, at the very least, the part where you are innocent). You CAN lie (which is usually what murderers do, don't they?) as long as nobody catches you on that. This also means that when playing for the first time you can mess up your testimony entirely, but in a game of deduction I find the possibility to be wrong to be A POSITIVE.  Game has its own internal clock, which tracks WHEN you do something - time is of the essence. Thankfully the in-game timer is fairly leisurely. In fact, it goes forward so slowly on its own that you will most likely find time-sinks quite useful. These are simple objects such as gazette or phone you can interact with. They serve as time-sinks and their purpose is to propel the timer to a desired moment in time. So don't be afraid that you will have to speedrun through the game because 'the clock is ticking'.  When starting the game gives you an attorney who does two things:   1. He reminds you of important events when they will appear, which helps planning out your next move or moves. It's very important when you start, not as much when you are on another run (it's nice that game features multiple endings and possible combinations in the story, which is a big deal because one full run can be fairly short in terms of playing time).  2. He gives you clues that can help you defend against the charges made by the prosecutor (by the way the prosecutor himself does really good job at introducting you to the game by explaining who you are, what you did and generally what's going on). The clues are a good way of directing you through the game, even if it can be a bit annoying at first that you have to explore the in-game world in order to gather knowledge of things 'you' - the main character of the story - should know by now.  A side note on the evidence files themselves - I found them to be done very well. The font, the visuals... Suffice to say I liked going through them. The only flaw was no option to jump through different categories of evidences, which could help new players as some evidence is linked together, which forces you to jump back and forth between them.  I enjoyed the voice acting. The main characters' way of commenting on EVERYTHING he does gets annoying at some point, but it also does reinforce the feeling that you are testifying before the court. It's just the frequency of it that's a bit off (to a point that it gets hilarious). Another plus side of the voice acting is the actual French accent that fits well into where the action takes place (France) - it adds to the atmoshpere.  On the graphical side of things I can say that for the most part it serves its purpose, although the animations leave a lot to be desired (and I mean A LOT). It's fairly visible that everything was done by a very small team (or a single person, if I am not mistaken). The main reason why I am so forgiving about the visual side of the games is their gameplay. So if the graphics is very important to you - be warned.  The Bohemian Killing's biggest strength is how unique it is. It does have some flaws in terms of executing its excellent concept, but ultimately it was fun and interesting experience when I was pushing my brain cells to convince the Judge to my story.",1,1

206440,To the Moon,"To the moon is a short point and click adventure developed in RPG Maker. However, the overall game is mainly an interactive story, and most of the actual gameplay mechanics exist mainly to drive the plot forward. The story is about a machine in the future which can alter the past memories of a dying man, allowing him to achieve his personal dreams. Akin to the film Eternal Sunshine of a Spotless Mind, the game tackles the the morality of altering memories, and explores broad themes of love, childhood, and self-sacrifice. The most outstanding component of the game for me was the music, specifically 'For River,' that conveyed emotion very effectively and has stuck with me the most after finishing the game.  The game took me approximately 3.5 hours to complete, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in an adventure game that tells a short love story. I would not recommend this to someone who dislikes purely narrative driven games.",1,0

206420,Saints Row IV,"I accepted after The Third that I was unlikely to get a serious Saints Row again, and I'm over that. The gameplay of this jumps into a completely different area of interest for me, superheroes, and it takes no time at all to start jumping and soon flying around the city, and yet the entire time I felt...bored. The story line rarely requires use of powers except to get from point A to point B, the enemies you fight are never much of a threat even with the difficulty turned up, because any time you start to be overwhelmed you can just run away faster than they can travel. The challenges, many of which are returning from The Third, are so easy you can breeze through them. It's never a good thing when a game that has an exciting mechanic handled well somehow manages to make it seem dull at the same time. I got this on the cheap from Humble Bundle and I still feel like I paid too much. If the creators wanted to make a superhero game, maybe they should have done that and wiped off the logo, rather than focusing me through convoluted plot twists and pop culture references in order to explain the powers. The problem appears to stem from a lack of direction. The game wants to be too many different things, so instead of a strong showing, it's just a mediocre mashup.",-1,0

Another one played for 0.2 hours, who is also a COD enthusiast. He felt too ♥♥♥♥ing LAGGY, he described he walked stumbly in the game, like a old man with arthritis AND without his crutch.   The last one DID NOT START PLAYING AT ALL, EVEN FOR ONE SECOND.   I bought this game anyway, because of the fascinating zombie modes from BO1 and BO2. now I just wanna say,   1. if is game is supposed to be in a BO trilogy, why I can't even find the slightest clue that BO3 is linked to BO1 and BO2??? Thanks to BO3's brandnew storyline. Make it an indie game, stop naming it BO3, Treyarch.   2. WTBH and WTF, one level of this game tries to imitate a horror game, plus, a WW2 solder wielding a future weapon, how lazy you are, Treyarch. At least let him wield a WW2 gun.  3. WOW the only thing this game impressed me, is its 64 GB huge bulky big rump!   Great work, Treyarch, you created the brand of CODBO, now you killed it. Also lost faith in this game's zombie mode with its future weapons :( (3/10)",-1,1

This aint your average 'Battlefield' or 'CoD' experience which will have you placed in game lobbies consisting of a maximum of 50 players, this game is very very different. After the tutorial you will find yourself plopped into battle with up to 100 people of all skill levels and all different factions at time. This can be very frustrating if you are trying to learn the basic game mechanics as a newbie. Yet the game is fun at times and feels rather rewarding whenever you capture a landmass from one of your two rival factions, or if you are defending one of your landmasses from them even. Id rate this game a 7/10 but im sure you will enjoy it more than me if you are willing to mpump several dozen hours into it.",1,0

236390,War Thunder,"It's difficult to recommend this game.  TANKS  It's very well done technically and the graphics are great. It *CAN* be fun to play.  But...  The tanks are quite unbalanced. While this is historical, it still leaves a lot of frustration in a straight matchup. Random battles make for random teams comprised of all types of tanks from every nation so it's mostly worked around but it makes for really stale matches where everyone is using the same stuff. Most matches are completely one sided and certain tiers are completely dominated by certain vehicles (e.g - Tier 2 and the 88 Flak truck)  These vehicles can fire from very long distances and completely disable you in a single shot. Most shots will disable you after they hit you, so there's that to take into account anyway.  I think a lot of the problem with the different planes/tanks is the way that match making works. You can be matched with players running tanks + or - 1 battle rank from yours.  If you are using a battle rank 3.0 tank or plane, you can face people with battle rank 2.0 - 4.0.  4.0 tanks tend to have fairly large advantages over 3.0 tanks, so this can be very frustrating if it keeps happening (and it will).  It can be a very frustrating game. You will die a lot and quickly, often without knowing that the guy who shot you was there.  Spawn camping is RAMPANT and won't ever be addressed.  Random players often do not take map objectives. In fact, other players are a really large part of what make random battles frustrating. Not enough people are trying to win the game. They just sit on hills and ridges and snipe at each other. It gets really boring, really quickly.  There's quite a bit of grinding to progress. If you're very good at the game, you'll progress quickly enough though.  Driving tanks is fun though, so I keep playing.  AIR  I don't play much air, however, a lot of the same gripes regarding balance are present but are workable given the nature of random battles. Planes go down very quickly, and small plane crews means that once the pilot gets knocked out, you're done.  Spawn camping isn't a problem, but the grind is arguably larger here than in tank games given the larger distances in air maps (less kills over a longer time period due to travel time to the enemy).   It seems I progressed slower in the air than I did on the ground.",1,0

313160,Farming Simulator 15,"Even real farmers play Farming Simulator! Whilst it is still a little way from being a simulator in the true sense of the word (for example, gears are not fully simulated, tractors do not show real damage, crops grow too fast and its a bit too easy to make money), nevertheless, the positives far outweigh the negatives, and for every weakness, there are many realistic features. It's great fun if you have any interest in farming and you like the productive strategy type game rather than the fast paced shooters. I worked on a farm many years ago, and I played with Britains farm toys as a kid. This game, 40yr later, allows me to own and drive any type of tractor &amp; implement, and farm any crop, &amp; the physics and graphics are easily good enough to bring back the memories of driving the real thing. Giants also give good support, they updated FS2013 regularly, so I hope to see the same improvements and developments in this one;and they offer good (many free) addon mods form time to time. It's also very moddable, so if there is an aspect that lets the game down, it is very likely that someone has added a mod to fix it, or else you can do it yourself. For example, it is not difficult to edit the start machinery and funds, or to change growth rate or values to make the game more difficult, or even to create your own map with a bit of learning.  Stand by to be labelled a farm nerd (similar to trainspotter), but that matters not to me. Excellent game, worth at least 8 out of 10 on release, and expecting that to rise with future patches. :)",1,1

Infinite New Game + options and a really interesting system of stats and abilities make it much more accessible for people who are usually not that great at roguelikes.

255070,Abyss Odyssey,"More like a rogue-like fighting game than a metroidvania style game, which will probably throw a lot of people off at first. You're going to need to give the enemies more attention than you're used to, and the controls will not be like those of a platformer.  But if you're willing to put some effort into learning the controls, it can be a very challenging and fun title.    The art style and atmosphere created make this one of my favorite games. The enemies are interesting and well scripted, so that you'll need to learn their individual strategies and weaknesses in order to deal with them. The three main playable characters have very different fighting styles and allow for customization of weapons, accessories and special moves. These can synergize to give the player much more power when the right combinations are found.  The levels are procedurally generated, so each playthrough you'll want to pay attention to the map layout to find the most desirable route. The different difficulties make quite a bit of difference in AI ability, and you'll want to stick to the easy levels until you get the hang of it.  ",1,0

I now have spend a huge load of time in this game and tried to catch every aspect. I know you guys dont want to read walls of reviews, so Ill try to keep it short:  pros: -very unique art style, map detail grade is good -many classes to pick gives the game a great replay factor -some interessting mechanics Ive never seen before   cons: -massive fps droprate; in fact I have better fps in Black Desert Online with ultra settings in towns as in ToS -idiotic profanity filter that blocks words randomly, makes comunication frustrating at some point (words like 'competition' are block because '♥♥♥' is somewhere in the middle and there are some worse examples) -many classes available but only a few are useful and being known as meta while all others are barely or never accepted for endcontent, making it impossible to explore new builds without the fear that you end up being unwanted at any party -item trading is so restricted that you feel imprisioned at your own account, later you often find items that are very rare but cannot be used by your class and you cannot sell or give it another character on your account which is nothing but frustrating -maintance updates are a joke, in fact the comunity already made running gags about that more loading screens are realeased as actual bug fixes, its bitter but true -bots are a massive problem and are at least 1/3 of the overall population  -updates actually making the game experience more and more worse and no, I am serious with that; just take a look at the (currently) latest update where they actually cutted all map channels mindlessly and read how the comunity responses  https://forum.treeofsavior.com/t/known-issues-july-5th/308815/42   -the support is useless, does nothing, barely answers at problem in the forum; we have a big wave of botters who just stand afk with an minion and not a single of them ever complained in the forum because no one ever got a pentalty for macro botting - latest example can be found here:  https://forum.treeofsavior.com/t/sa-silute-dina-bee-farm-l-sp-potion-bots-l-sorcerer-c2-and-necromancer-c2-issue/307984/4  if the GM says he will check it, it means he just replied to calm down everyone and pretend something will happen but the majority of the comunity already realized that nothing will ever happen  -mob spawns come in waves map wide which often means you have empty spots; path design is worse and you always have to return into the opposite direction where you have cleared everything which means you often walk for over a minute before you find the first mob again",-1,1

First Enemy: the common enemy, it's fast and weak, but they appear in big number Second Enemy: uncommon enemy, Marksman, appear in few numbers, try to run away from you, die with few hits Third Enemy: Golem, can shoot from far an explosive bullet that hits a few times before disappearing, are very slow, hits you with a slow attack when you go near them, can easily be defeated by avoiding their attacks  Boss: Like fighting a golem, have few very slow attacks, a lot of hp, just attack and dodge his slow attacks, the only thing that make it 'hard' is that at 75% hp he will summon the First Enemies, then at 50% he will summon the Second Enemies and at 25% he will summon a Golem, but yeah, they are weak, too, so just attack him avoiding his attack...and anyway there are heals everywhere.  This looks like a game made by someone who found a nice Graphic Engine somewhere and did want to make a game with it, nice job with the envoirment, but the game looks totally uncomplete.  1) You just have basic attack and a kick 2) No sense on jump, you can pass through anything with your OP dodge 3) Dodge have no cooldown, is like istant, can pass through any monster 4) You have Mana but you have no spells or skills 5) Monsters drop something, but those things are useless since they just disappear when you get them and you get nothing  There are no dialogues, there is just a Chinese text when you get in a new Area, there is no XP, when you are hitten you don't recive any warning about you being hitted (or you do but not if you are hitten by the first enemies); when you attack an enemy it's like if they don't care about it and keep doing their attacks, so if you fight a bunch of enemies, it's just about attacking and reciving damage. There is a Continue button in the Menu, but you can't save and if you die you have to restart.  Game completed in less than an hour and I did die because of a bug in the middle, so yeah, you can finish it in like 30 minutes",-1,0

364230,Lucius Demake,I found this game very enjoyable little puzzle game to spend few hours to. Some of the puzzles were easy but other took some time to figure out (or more like remembering that there's a map). Graphics remind me of c64 games and animation is fluent and easy to watch. And I really like the way characters move their arms while walking XD. Music is cool and retroish making you think of arcade games. Playability is good and controls are easy to learn. I didn't notice any bugs while playing so if there are any they aren't game breaking. All in all this is a great little game that is worth the price and time.,1,0

201040,Galcon Legends,"As a quick note, this is my first Galcon game and I saw in the ending credits that the team that made the game was pretty small, so I'll keep that in mind in this review.  The game itself isn't a total bust, but it's plagued by some rather fatal flaws and limited playability.    Gameplay  - The gameplay itself is pretty fun and quick-paced, but ultimately falls flat as well. You basically use preassigned resources/planets to expand and conquer other planets. The level of strategy needed is bare-minimum and doesn't go any deeper past what I just mentioned. Adding bonus planets or stations, anything really would have helped immeasurably. It's also boring that enemies have special traits (moving faster, quicker resource building, exploding planets) and the player has none and never gets any.  Later stages made me think how natural the gameplay felt for multiplayer, but not before they attend to what I mentioned above.  One of the most annoying and most fixable things is the difficulty. It's incredibly annoying that the game asks you after every single match to change your difficulty, it's just common sense to allow the player to choose once prior to entering the campaign and not constantly during. The difficulty of the stages are very erratic as well and doesn't flow well in to end-game either.  Lastly the art wasn't terrible, but the character designs were so bland and uninspired.    Audio  - Muted. Nothing special, closer to the annoying side than the pleasing.    Story  - Please get a writer. The jokes always fell incredible short and the dialogue was very sparse as is. The idea of a galactic bill collector was kind of funny, too bad nothing else was.    At the end of the day so much could have been fixed by some good old quality assurance, but instead fails in sadly just about every area.",-1,0

113200,The Binding of Isaac,"This Zelda-like game is far from unique. Our story takes place in the house of Isaac and his mother, who live a peaceful life. But things take a turn for the worse, when Isaac's mother hears a voice from above, demanding Isaac as a sacrifice. Isaac escapes to the basement, where all his fears become reality, and where many have been lost...Including his brothers and sisters... Explore the basement, caves and depths of Isaac's nightmares as you battle frightful monsters, The Seven Deadly Sins, Satan, and even Mom herself.  Arm yourself with over 80 powers and abillities to defeat the monsters below. A great game for those who have a strong stomach, and well worth the resonable price of £4.00. Replay value is exellent for a game of such small value. There is no demo currently available on Steam, but you can find the demo on  Newgrounds.com .",1,0

I suppose if you're interested in killing waves of dinosaurs in mundane locations you may enjoy this game, but the game is awfully boring hence the dollar price tag and constant sale for .50 cents. Plus you have the fact the developer is shady and probaly about to be sued.  'Just so people are aware, this game's name use to be Orion Dino Beat Down, and they changed the name and re released it multiple times as a new game just to keep people from seeing all of the negative feedback it was getting. This is the same game that utilizes stolen assets and the head of Trek Industries, formerly spiral game studios fired the real team working on it just before release without paying them. I'm writing this review now because they are attempting to get out of a DMCA and possible suit of their new game 'Orion' where they are literally doing the same exact thing and trying to play the victim. I bought this game before even knowing all of this, and felt so dirty for doing so, and im hoping and urging people away from buying into this mistake and scum of a company.' - ViziTronMan ",-1,0

249130,LEGO® MARVEL Super Heroes,"LEGO Marvel Superheores is a great game. I really like this game, and recommend it to anyone that likes Lego and Marvel. Has a huge range of characters and has a large free-roam area to do what ever you want in. the only problem, only two boats, but that's not a big deal.  The game can be a bit glitchly at times but keeps you entertained for hours. When i mean glitchy, i mean real glitchy. I found this glitch with Thor, where i turned into the citizen? And i found two spots where i could go under the city and onto the islands in the background? I also was on the other side of the bridge, where i couldn't go. What? When they say there are a lot of characters, they are correct, because there are something like over 100 playable, and thats without the DLC. The DLC was pretty good, giving you extra vehicles and characters, but most of their abilities were the same as other characters, so i recommend waiting until they are on special as they are not worth their full price.  The steam achievments are also good and provide something else to do in the free-roam city.  Just a warning, there are cheat codes, but the one for the hulkbuster prevents you from getting 100%, so i don't recommend using them. There are a lot of bonus levels, which some give a good laugh. Suitable for all ages, even little kittens.  Score 9.5/10",1,1

10100,King's Quest Collection,"As a young kid I played these games religiously. I used to write letters to Sierra asking for help and they'd respond via snail mail. That was before AOL 4.0. These games have aged as well as can be expected. Simply put, if someone created these types of games today and marketed them as 'retro', 'pixel graphics', 'point and click', 'text adventures' etc.- I doubt they would be as well made as the KQC games. The nostalgia is overwhelming, the quality of the content is priceless, and the feeling of solving a puzzle is unparalleled. If you are around 30, you probably paid $150 or more for the box set back at Media Play. The games are almost as fun today at a fraction of the price. kQV... 'Look out Graham, that's a poiiiiiiisonnnnnus snake!' And KQIV? Come on, completing the game 100 points over the maximum score? KQ3, finding the right ingredients in the spell book to advance their game. KQVI, making your way into the castle for the first time just waiting for your opportunity to return. VIi, those graphics - the epic ending where the win / lose was completely random based on your computers mood. So many memories. Where is Laura Bow and the dagger of amen ra?

286940,S.K.I.L.L. - Special Force 2,"An okay game if you don't want to spend money on a better alternative.  Aiming is annoying. Just try it. Ugly modelling has its cons. People can glitch themselves up on certain places. High ping is an advantage. As a low ping player I can't hit high ping enemy. Reload itself is longer than the animation for it. Disturbing, common issue. People hack freely. Grinding SP takes forever. --&gt; So unfun, groups of people rather wintrade or team up to get it. Now I'd call that team spirit. However, used weapons need repair. So if you played some games and got an achievement with +500 SP, that will barely cover your expenditures. Everything except the basic weapons cost money. You can't even change your annoying scope.  My opinion in addition: -playing really feels like it's a cheap copycat of &lt;choose a well-known FPS game&gt;. Because it is. -some skins and clothes really don't belong in the game. (and many of them are even ugly, half-♥♥♥♥♥ job). -many players agree if I whine about grinding or common issues. that's funny.",1,0
267490,Batman™: Arkham Origins Blackgate - Deluxe Edition,"Honestly, this game is really frustrating to play. The controls are largely unresponsive (I use a Microsoft Wired Xbox 360 Pad) and so you can be pressing the counter button with it not doing anything, and the mechanics of the game are very frustrating at times. The Map is a 3D mess that is over-complicated for the game. There are times when you literally have no idea where you are or how you got there. The Boss fights are either ridiculously easy or overly hard and the fact that the game ues check points is very frustrating on the bosses. You can beat the same bosses first couple of phases over and over again, but if you die then you have to redo the entire fight from the start (including any cut scenes) which just gets overly frustrating (particularly on the Penguin boss fight because his gaurds can seem to see you even when they have their back to you).   The controls are a mess too, and so sometimes you need to hold 'A' to enter a vent, sometimes its Down + 'A', sometimes the Right Trigger button or sometimes its Down + Right Trigger. When you are trying to escape an enemy with a gun, you can be pressing the buttons you usually press to get away, but this particular room might have a completely differnt set of buttons. It really is just a mess.   The combat is repetitive and boring too. You can start a combo on an enemy and rather than seeing different attacks, Batman just throws the same punch over and over again until the final blow (which does differ). It just feels really lacking compared the real Arkham Games.   Another thing which is overdone and frustrating is the constant back tracking. You need to enter each wing to get a piece of Bat-Tech for the next wings Puzzle, but then have to re-enter them to get the access codes and then re-enter each one again to fight the bosses. Finally you have to re-enter them yet again because you have to disarm some Bombs which have been placed right in the dead centre of each zone. In all honesty, this game would probably last an hour if you didn't have to back track so much. It's pretty clear to me that they have just added the back-tracking in to ensure the game has a longer play time, but for me it wasn't fun, it was very boring and very frustrating getting lost constantly.   I have loved all of the Arkham games and DLC and even though this was a side scroller beat em up, I wanted to love it too but I just can't. I honestly have more fun playing an old 80's side scroller like Streets of Rage or Final Fight than I had during the several hours this took to complete.   I feel bad leaving this review if I am honest, but I just can't say anything nice about this game. Even the story itself is pretty bland and doesn't make much sense. I wanted to play it because I had heard it bridged the gap between Arkham origins and Arkham Asylum, but to be truthful I could have easily never played this and still felt like the games bridged by themselves. The story just doesn't link the games for me, and it made the overall frustration factor even worse because I might as well have not wasted my time.   I honestly wouldn't recommend buying this game. If you get it free from a Bundle of the other Arkham games, then sure give it a play. But honestly, I regret buying this game.",-1,0

If you play a lot of TD you know what I mean. The positive things are the towers are pretty original and there is enough of them to make it fun for a while, animations are good, maps are good (small is my only complaint) and good tower upgrades. Again, well worth the low price IMO, probably good for 10+ hours if your a TD lover. ",1,0
10090,Call of Duty: World at War,"Synopsis  Born in Austria in 1889, Adolf Hitler rose to power in German politics as leader of the National Socialist German Workers Party, also known as the Nazi Party. Hitler was chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945, and served as dictator from 1934 to 1945. His policies precipitated World War II and the Holocaust. Hitler committed suicide with wife Eva Braun on April 30, 1945, in his Berlin bunker.  Early Years  Dictator Adolf Hitler was born in Braunau am Inn, Austria, on April 20, 1889, and was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and Klara Polzl. When Hitler was 3 years old, the family moved from Austria to Germany. As a child, Hitler clashed frequently with his father. Following the death of his younger brother, Edmund, in 1900, he became detached and introverted. His father did not approve of his interest in fine art rather than business. In addition to art, Hitler showed an early interest in German nationalism, rejecting the authority of Austria-Hungary. This nationalism would become the motivating force of Hitler's life.  Alois died suddenly in 1903. Two years later, Adolf's mother allowed her son to drop out of school. He moved to Vienna and worked as a casual laborer and a watercolor painter. Hitler applied to the Academy of Fine Arts twice, and was rejected both times. Out of money, he moved into a homeless shelter, where he remained for several years. Hitler later pointed to these years as the time when he first cultivated his anti-Semitism, though there is some debate about this account.  At the outbreak of World War I, Hitler applied to serve in the German army. He was accepted in August 1914, though he was still an Austrian citizen. Although he spent much of his time away from the front lines, Hitler was present at a number of significant battles and was wounded at the Somme. He was decorated for bravery, receiving the Iron Cross First Class and the Black Wound Badge.  3 GALLERY 3 Images Hitler became embittered over the collapse of the war effort. The experience reinforced his passionate German patriotism, and he was shocked by Germany's surrender in 1918. Like other German nationalists, he believed that the German army had been betrayed by civilian leaders and Marxists. He found the Treaty of Versailles degrading, particularly the demilitarization of the Rhineland and the stipulation that Germany accept responsibility for starting the war.  After World War I, Hitler returned to Munich and continued to work for the military as an intelligence officer. While monitoring the activities of the German Workers’ Party (DAP), Hitler adopted many of the anti-Semitic, nationalist and anti-Marxist ideas of DAP founder Anton Drexler. Drexler invited Hitler to join the DAP, which he did in 1919.  To increase its appeal, the DAP changed its name to the Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei (NSDAP). Hitler personally designed the party banner, featuring a swastika in a white circle on a red background. Hitler soon gained notoriety for his vitriolic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles, rival politicians, Marxists and Jews. In 1921, Hitler replaced Drexler as NSDAP party chairman.  Hitler's vitriolic beer-hall speeches began attracting regular audiences. Early followers included army captain Ernst Rohm, the head of the Nazi paramilitary organization, the Sturmabteilung (SA), which protected meetings and frequently attacked political opponents.  On November 8, 1923, Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3,000 people at a large beer hall in Munich. Hitler announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government. After a short struggle including 20 deaths, the coup, known as the 'Beer Hall Putsch,' failed.  Hitler was arrested three days later and tried for high treason. He served a year in prison, during which time he dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf ('My Struggle') to his deputy, Rudolf Hess. The book laid out Hitler's plans for transforming German society into one based on race.  Rise to Power  The Great Depression in Germany provided a political opportunity for Hitler. Germans were ambivalent to the parliamentary republic and increasingly open to extremist options. In 1932, Hitler ran against Paul von Hindenburg for the presidency. Hitler came in second in both rounds of the election, garnering more than 35 percent of the vote in the final election. The election established Hitler as a strong force in German politics. Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor in order to promote political balance.  Hitler used his position as chancellor to form a de facto legal dictatorship. The Reichstag Fire Decree, announced after a suspicious fire at the Reichstag, suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial. Hitler also engineered the passage of the Enabling Act, which gave his cabinet full legislative powers for a period of four years and allowed deviations from the constitution.  Having achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government, Hitler and his political allies embarked on a systematic suppression of the remaining political opposition. By the end of June, the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding. On July 14, 1933, Hitler's Nazi Party was declared the only legal political party in Germany.  Military opposition was also punished. The demands of the SA for more political and military power led to the Night of the Long Knives, which took place from June 30 to July 2, 1934. Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders, along with a number of Hitler's political enemies, were rounded up and shot.  The day before Hindenburg's death in August 1934, the cabinet had enacted a law abolishing the office of president and combining its powers with those of the chancellor. Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government, and was formally named as leader and chancellor. As head of state, Hitler became supreme commander of the armed forces. He began to mobilize for war. Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, and Hitler announced a massive expansion of Germany’s armed forces.  The Nazi regime also included social reform measures. Hitler promoted anti-smoking campaigns across the country. These campaigns stemmed from Hitler's self-imposed dietary restrictions, which included abstinence from alcohol and meat. At dinners, Hitler sometimes told graphic stories about the slaughter of animals in an effort to shame his fellow diners. He encouraged all Germans to keep their bodies pure of any intoxicating or unclean substance.  A main Nazi concept was the notion of racial hygiene. New laws banned marriage between non-Jewish and Jewish Germans, and deprived 'non-Aryans' of the benefits of German citizenship. Hitler's early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities, and later authorized a euthanasia program for disabled adults.  The Holocaust was also conducted under the auspices of racial hygiene. Between 1939 and 1945, Nazis and their collaborators were responsible for the deaths of 11 million to 14 million people, including about 6 million Jews, representing two-thirds of the Jewish population in Europe. Deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps and through mass executions. Other persecuted groups included Poles, communists, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and trade unionists, among others. Hitler probably never visited the concentration camps and did not speak publicly about the killings.  World War II  In 1938Hitler, along with several other European leaders, signed the Munich Agreement. The treaty ceded the Sudetenland districts to Germany, reversing part of the Versailles Treaty. As a result of the summit, Hitler was named Time magazine's Man of the Year for 1938. This diplomatic win only whetted his appetite for a renewed German dominance. On September 1, Germany invaded Poland. In response, Britain and France declared war on Germany",1,1

359920,Highlands,"Highlands is a unique strategy game that does exactly what it says on its store page. But just as importantly the devs at Burrito Studio are VERY responsive to community input. Steam achievements are already in and a new 'casual' difficulty is being added (within the next day or so) mainly due to the fact that Highlands' gameplay is so different to what we are used to that extra climatisation may well be needed for the average player despite already having a well made integrated tutorial. There is little doubt that this is a challenge that none should take lightly. In addittion, the guys have added some nice extra features including extra craftable consumables, extra character abilities, and extra enemy abilities. All in all, the 1.1 build will radically alter an already good game for the better making Highlands very close to being a must-buy for anyone interested in a fresh look at the tactical turn based with RPG elements genre. Overall an extremely professional piece of work destined, at the very least, to become a cult classic.  *edit* Don't underestimate that word 'unique' up there - everyone claims it but few actually achieve it.",1,0

377160,Fallout 4,"I wish there was a middle option between thumbs up and down for how I feel about this game. Don't get this game expecting an RPG as good as New Vegas. Get this game if you want something with a Fallout setting, but more of a Borderlands or Far Cry feel. Theres a world to explore and the gun play is solid, but gone are the RPG mechanics. The story is nonsense, most things are wasted potential or not fleshed out enough. Your SPECIAL build is not imporant and most of the perks are pointless since there are some obvious 'mandatory' ones. Gone are actual dialog choices replaced with an absolutely insulting 4 choice wheel akin to Mass Effect. Get a mod ASAP to flesh out the full dialgoue, but it's still not good enough. This game is a disappointing addition to the series, but go in having very low expectations and theres still fun to be had running around the world and collecting loot and just rolling with the ridiculously bad story. Play New Vegas if you want a solid RPG, play Fallout 4 if you want a solid shooter.  Pros -Much improved graphics, animations, and gun play over previous modern titles. -Some great music, although some of it recycled from older games on the radio stations -Fairly big world to explore -More intuitive system to sort throught chests -A solid FPS game  Cons -Not an RPG, stats don't matter -Very few enemy types. Very few animals. Get used to raiders and super mutants. -Very very few towns/cities. Unacceptably low. -Lack of random events and a generally low number of actual quests.  -All the locations on the map exist just to be kill or fetch radiant quests -Dumbed down dialog, choices are meaningless and lead to same outcome. Speech checks are gone, fun things like Black Widow don't have any unique options. No stat checks. -Pacing is awful. Within one hour of the game you have power armor (with no training), a minigun, and become the general of an army -The whole world revolves around you. You become the most imporant person in every faction. -All the factions are poorly written, none of them are fleshed out, and I still don't understand the Institutes motivations even after seeing all the endings -Terrible story. The main plot is 'resolved' about 50% through the game, but for some reason the game continues? -Handful of forced references to reference Fallout 3, but continously ignore New Vegas -Wasted potential. Locations such as the Combat Zone doesn't have a quest line, the USS Constitution kind of just ends abrubtly, too many radiant quests for factions. Not all the compnaions have a quest. -Settlement building is bare minimum. Very few build options, difficult to construct multi floor buildings. Defense don't matter. Enemies will teleport to the middle of your town bypass defenes, kidnap people, and there's nothing you can do about it. Settlement happiness has no logic to it. Good luck getting the 100 happiness achievement. -Armor pieces. You cannot wear any of the armor outfits in the game as it disallows wearing pieces along with it. Even if you wanted to the stats are much lower than the armor pieces. Solved with a mod, but incredibly poor design. There are only about 4-5 choices for armor piece which is very low. -Legendary weapons make weapons less unique and more RNG. Finding a named weapon is just a legendary weapon you could have received as a random drop. Not many new weapon types compared to old games either (one maybe two?) -Not really any intresting choices in the perk tree. Three-five mandatory points into each gun style of your choice, lockpicking, hacking, crafting, and science. This late in the series I would have expected something new. -200 years since the bombs fell and the world is littered with skeletons for some reason. They are even in towns and settlements and unremoveable  EDIT: I wrote this in the comments, but people don't seem to know how to read so I'll put it here:   Not sure what people's logic are with saying 'Hey look he played it alot!' I paid 40 something for the game of course I'm going to play it. I also got all the achievements for it, while not difficult shows I actually explored everything the game has to offer. You're allowed to be dissappointed with something and still see good in it. I don't want to see future games be dumbed down like this and expressing concerns is the best way to do that. I'm not alone in this seeing as how 4's user reviews are drasticly lower than New Vegas. The review score average has been steadily decreasing as time passes as well.",-1,1

304050,Trove,"I've been playing Trove for quite a while now, so i'm a bit of an experienced player. This game is probably one of the best games i've run accross, here is what I think.  Pros:  Definitly is a great MMO-RPG What I mean is, the 'role playing game' is important and without a team after level 12 you WILL die. A LOT. The 'mmo' part, it has an AMAZING community, one of the best i've seen in any game. Great class veriety. Hey, thats always important. You can edit your looks anytime, for free! I'ts growing SUPER quick! I've noticed so many new people through the week. (and their usually advanced players) There are a lot more, but that will take a bit long and its all about the crafting system. Also, best of all its not pay to progress or be OP. IT'S ALL FREE TO PLAY! Well 99% of it.  Cons: The building is dreadful. The way to build your cornerstone (little plot you own) is hard and frustrating for everyone that I have met who owns this game. They released it today, that means 'new people!' but sadly, not only are there new people but, come trollers, hackers, and giant noobies to the MMORPG genre. I havn't encountered hackers yet but, i'm sure I will.  Other then that it's a great game and suggest you to check it out if you havn't, just give it some time.  ps. don't listen to my hours I have a lot more then that.",1,1

20900,The Witcher: Enhanced Edition," Pros:  -Intriguing plot -Morally grey RPG -Excellent voice acting -Excellent music   Cons:  -Poorly designed combat system -Plot pacing problems - chapter 2 is hell, chapter 4 is random -Dated graphics -Occasional questline glitches -Plot ultimately self contained and skippable   Overall:  This review is my first time playing any Witcher game. And I can honestly say, it's fun. It's dated and it has its rough edges, but it's fun. But play for the plot and the RPG choices, not the combat. And it's the first part of the Witcher series of games. I haven't read the books or played any of the other games, but this game has made me want to. Apparently they improve on almost everything.  That said, this game has a horribad combat system. It's just... the worst. Crafting is just relevant enough to be an irritating sidequest, and honestly, the gameplay just feels unpolished. That's a pretty severe criticism, and is a deal breaker for a lot of people.  If you can look past the gameplay issues, the story is amazing. Your choices revolve around one of three possible endings, and the plot has some great twists and turns to it. Ultimately, though, this game's plot is self contained and is only mildly referenced in the second Witcher, and not at all in the third. Thus, you can easily just look up a plot synopsis on this game and be good to go.  So really, it's a toss up. This is not the best RPG you'll ever play. You don't lose much by skipping it. But it's still a solid RPG. Decide for yourself.   Bottom Line:  Fifty fifty. By itself, apart from all the rest of the series, it's worth playing. Grab it on a sale if you want to play through it for the experience.",1,1

373420,Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition,"Somehow the developers made something well designed and extremely fun, even better then it was before. Divinity is already a game that speaks for itself in most aspects. The graphics, the combat, the story, and customization and options were all top notch and exceeded most peoples expectations. Truly it's a Kickstarter story success. Bringing all the elements of CRPG titles that you know and love, and giving each feature an awesome modern twist. From Co-op/Multiplayer to amazing quests. The Enhanced edition brings more in the form of sharpened graphics, voice acting, controller support, and making the game much more friendly to new players. At the same time they have added new challenges to keep fans of the original title salivating and challenging their tactics and parties to the limit. Being a new player to Divinity, I instantly fell in love with this title and I don't want to look back. This game brings everything I loved about D&amp;D, Ultima, and does things in its own unique style. Giving you the freedom to choose your own party, your own adventure, and have an amazing time while exploring the vast world and lore of Divinity. If you are a fan of CRPG's, there is no reason you shouldn't own this title. Which brings me again back to how amazing it is that they made a great game an even better game. That is a fine line to walk and Larian Studios did it, and did it well.

242920,Banished,"Few people are aware of my crippling video game addiction (mostly because I spent too much time playing therefore I have no social life) so today I’m outing myself and putting this problem to good use.  Banished is the indie game brainchild of one man, Luke Hodorowicz, the founder of Shining Rock Software. There isn’t a specific back story to the game; all you know is that you were banished (for an unknown reason) to a remote area and it is up to you to plan the city and keep your villagers alive. It’s like a hybrid of Starcraft, SimCity, and the Civilization series.  I've spent roughly 48 hours playing this game. The first thing I noticed is how effing difficult this game is. I started playing on medium difficulty, fair weather, and disasters enabled. After a quick and painful death about 20 minutes into my adventure I had to switch to easy with mild weather. I left disasters enabled because I couldn’t 100% cheat.  Strategy is absolutely key in this game. Villagers need to have enough food and firewood to make it through the winter. Some clothes would be nice but my villagers quickly realized they can’t always get what they want. Without depleting my resources too badly I was able to set up a woodcutter, fields, livestock pens, fishing dock, hunting lodge, and a house for people gathering materials (food, herbs, etc) in the woods. Boom! Everyone had a job and the town made it through the harsh winter with enough food and firewood.  It was about this time I realized the game also mocks you. I was celebrating my victory over winter by looking for a place to build a marketplace and a trading post when I suddenly got alarms that villagers were dying. First three villagers, then ten…What the ♥♥♥♥? My boyfriend would dub this episode “The Spring of Death.” It all started with the tornado that killed all but five villagers. They started to rebuild their houses and stockpiles and just when it looked like they might bounce back…they ran out of food and died.  Overall, the range of play is great. The maps are large and plentiful. Each map (I’ve only played three but there are many more) has a water supply for fishing docks and trading posts. Some locations are easier to play than others. The location where all my villagers were wiped out was particularly difficult because it was surrounded by water and trees with little room for movement immediately. Hence the total destruction of everyone living within three feet of each other.  Unlike many strategy games players have everything they need right from the start. All players really need to be concerned with is hunting down raw materials like wood, iron, stone, and coal. Otherwise all buildings, skills, occupations, livestock, seeds, etc. are immediately available for construction and use. This may be off-putting for some gamers but I didn’t mind as it just made me think a bit more about strategy: Do I want a schoolhouse to teach children to be more efficient laborers or do I want the church to keep up village moral (unhappy villagers are not useful laborers)?  There is no story line which is great because I hate to play a plot based game. Also it doesn’t appear to have a finish line either which is new to me. There is no way to “win”. The whole purpose of the game is simply to survive and grow your town into a thriving medieval metropolis. Occasionally things pop up where villagers might steal food and you have to decide how to handle that but there is no central plot based play.  I loved this game. Hardcore. Even when I knew I wasn’t going to be able to survive a particular map I still gave it my all (I got a little involved) for the sake of the villagers. I think that’s the thrill of the game: knowing that I could lose at any moment made the little victories that much sweeter. Well worth the frustration and the money.",1,0

So at the very minimum, this game shows off the cool visual effects you can do with the engine.

Plus it doesn't take itself TOO seriously, and there is plenty of cross-game humor.  So far, the leveling system is actually pretty impressive, letting you specialize in specific kinds of play styles per character (e.g. a more attack based spellcaster, or a more magic oriented warrior type).  Definitely pick this one up if you feel like playing a blast-from-the-past RPG.",1,0

304050,Trove,"10/10 IGN - Would queue again.  Edit: More serious now. The game was good when it first came out on steam, even if it did had a queue that took 30 minutes to get past, but at least when you got in game, it was fun. Now, the game has become P2W, or Pay for Convinience, however you want to view it. Updates are now not as good, with less content being added, although I did hear they were planning a huge update with more slots. The game itself is good, or good concept, I should say, but now Trion tries to shove patron in your face with a new button on screen that takes you directly to a patron page, and radiants are now buyable from the store (or single radiant, whatever). Dragon coins are no longer tradeable, which is an annoyance, as they were a large part of the market and were perfectly fine the way they were, with me averaging around 20+ a day from dragon caches, giving me a steady flux income, but that is no longer possible. Oh, its unfortunate to see such a fun game that I poured over 300 hours into decline into what it is, but oh well. I enjoyed my time on this game with my club, and now the only reason I still have it installed is to go in and chat with the community in global. Was a 8 or 9 out of 10, now a 3 or 4 out of 10.

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"It's Metal Gear Solid(Minus the 'Solid' Snake weirdy enough) and Kojima. A usual recipe for greatness and here it is on PC with the Fox Engine running amazingly well though it is capped at 60fps. Graphics are excellent with great model detail and draw distances. Sound quality is great and directional. Both work well to complement the stealth/action/tactical gameplay.  Gameplay is where it is at though. Get this game for one of the best gameplay experiences to date. Departing from the general linarity of previous MGS games, MGS V is built around an open world where you undertake missions to progress the story, take on side missions to unlock content, develope your own private armed force or just free roam and be a general bad ♥♥♥.  As great as it is, it's not quite perfect. I have a few caveats. For one, mouse support in the PC is limited; as in you can't use the mouse in most menus(???? why ????) and the game doesn't support extra button buttons on mice. The game's audio options are nerfed for whatever reason; no options for controlling sound fx, music, or voice volume. I believe a lot of this has to do with the console port status of MGS V and Konami was too lazy to address these.   The in game save system is a mixed bag to me. It's not bad, but not good either. It's an automated checkpoint system and it 'usually' works enough. However I've had a few instances where I've messed things up so much late over an hour into a mission and wanted to go back a bit and the checkpoint save puts me way, way, way far back all the way to start of the mission. I really would had prefered a quick save or some kind of manual save system.   Anyway, 9/10. Get it. Everyone is playing it for a reason right now. It's Kojima's last great MGS game and possibly Konami's as well.",1,0
394230,Battleborn,"Advice: Comparing OW to BB is like taking a Cheetah and a Panther and expecting the exact same thing from both. Both, in their own right, are two dope ♥♥♥ animals so stop choosing sides and dividing the community and just play what you like.  Personally, this ♥♥♥♥ has been fun since I bought it. In my experience, I have seen a quite comedic game with very addictive controls and playing style. The story is its own deal, but still keeps the games specific multiplayer concepts in the core gameplay to kind of cross prepare the player for their objectives should they want to hit up the queues (which I personally haven't found dismal at all) and get to work with waxing the enemy team. The way the multiplayer is structured gives you decent diversity with about 3 modes (and potentially more if the community can help GBX get the game to its feet), each basically forcing you to play smart and work with your team to win. Basically, if you've played league or smite before, you'll get the gist of its teamwork based gameplay. I honestly felt that the game just got a huge ♥♥♥♥♥torm for its launch errors, which I agree were unacceptable (based on what I heard) but no reason to just flat out slander the game and drop it without at least letting the devs get to work fixing. Actually, after the beta that's probably what they were counting on with the community being so large then, but it basically bit the game in the butt and now you have people talking ♥♥♥♥ about the game and dissuading people, but then come back into the community and complain about it having no player base (cuz if you talk crap, things ALWAYS get better!). Fortunately though, the devs appear to give a crap and have been sliding in updates to help the game even at the behest of community recommendations regardless of the toxic community feedback. But no shaming, this game is total fun, with classic GBX humor, addictive gameplay, character specific lore challenges to keep you replaying for a LONG time and a dope ♥♥♥ cartoony touch to its finish.  Now this review could change, but until then I am proud to say that this game   Tips:   -I dont know what the buzz is, but I've never had to wait LONG periods of time for a match so it depends on your own personal situation   - The game is HILARIOUS when tackled with friends so I encourage any and all to add community members on steam to have great fun!  - Characters' abilities individually make each one a key factor in any match pending how you approach and use them so obviously some time is needed to get to know your favs and not favs  - Lore challenges are really grindy and make you have to sit down and bond with the character, but why buy a game if you can wipe it out in one sitting, eh?  - The devs actually care if you're willing to reach out to them. Im POSITIVE that almost any gamer understands how important it is for a game's devs to care about the community and it is fortunate that this game seems to be holding on to that for the time being.  Final Verdict: This game is dope, in spite of its fleeting flaws. Needs improvements but as much as that is on GBX it is also on us the fans to hunt for methods to collectively let them know what is up. Love the game and hope to see it move positively for the badass piece of work it is and could be!",1,0

211820,Starbound,"Update: They have added some ridiculously hard manditory dungeons (which are NOT fun for casual players), however, if you simply type /admin in while playing, you can Godmode through the dumb boss battles. Overall, because the exploring and building parts are fun (and there is a way to progress for casual players who may not want some insanely difficult battles just to be able to warp to other planets), the game is still fun to play.   ~ Original Review ~ (Written based on a much earlier version of the game)  This game is a lot of fun and has lots of decor-themed content. If you like building cool structures in Minecraft, then you'll probably like this game. If you are more battle oriented, however, you might find the battle system in Starbound to be rather lackluster. Since I'm not a battle person, however, I whole-heartedly recommend this game! It's creative and features a decent to good crafting system. And the pet rabbit on my spaceship is a nice addition. :)",1,0

232430,Gone Home,Well I can say I agree somewhat but for a casual game it fits the bill. I did however purchase it on sale as I would normally most indie games. I would however say I was satisfied with the story being interesting and the voice acting excellent. I left craving more information and possibly a tragic twist but some games were meant to be the way they turned out much like I feel this one was and did.   All in all I'd describe this game as a variation on the 'Escape the room' flash games that has you scouring the room for clues and secrets to fill in the blanks. I went in thinking the worst was going to happen and something was gonna jump out and try to kill me or I was gonna have to run from ghosts or monsters as you basically creep through your own home that you think no one is home at but everyone should be home to greet you especially after spending a year over seas.,1,0
208090,,"I've played 11+ hours of this game so far. It has some problems, but it's held my attention for short, one hour bursts. This is a small-scale FPS (4x4, either PvP or PvBots) with zany™ design elements reminiscent of Team Fortress 2.   At its heart, it's a cartoonish, frenetic, gore-filled, FPS. You build some weapons and then shoot enemies. Over time, you accrue experience not just for your character, but also the parts of the weapons you've been using. That's right, your  weapon stock  and  ammo type  goes up levels too. The catch: you have to spend Blutes (the in-game currency that you always earn alongside XP) in order to unlock that new level you've been working toward.  Currently, there aren't a lot of maps, and only standard playmodes. There are three character models available (to start) and a whole bunch of customizable bits of clothing in the Store. I'm an active SOE subscriber and have purchased station cash in the past. I'm not opposed to virtual purchases, but compared to every other game-purchase experience I've had, their costs feel high. I have no interest in either the virtual clothing options or the XP/Blute boosters, though that could change.  FPS fans that are accustomed to TF2-levels of variety may be disappointed. But problematic though it is, you can craft and evolve your weapons in a way that's quite new. There's some interesting promise in here, but games like these don't have very long to turn a profit.  All that said, I've had quite a blast so far and may yet drop some cash to show my support, even if I'm not enthused with their pricing structure. :)",1,0

205890,Chronicle: RuneScape Legends,"Hi all, i had been playing Runescape since about the age of 11 (2005) and always really enjoyed it but as i got older and new games come out, the call of Duty's, Grand Theft Auto's, Counter-Strikes etc i began to drift away from it and maybe going back for a month or 2 every so often just for a bit of nostalgia.  i saw this game on the store for free and with it being runescape related i thought id take a look at it, even though i have never played these type of card games before, unless Yu-Gi-Oh when i was 10 can be classed the same? but anyway, i read the reviews and they seemed pretty good on the whole but obviously every game is down to the personal preference so i tried it for myself.  so as mentioned, i never played this sort of game before and id say it took about an hour to become f**king hooked on it! i dont know what it is but something about it makes the game so so fun, wether its because its runescape related and some of the things you see on it give that nostalgic runescape feeling i dont know but it is such a good game.  The whole idea of ranking up, unlocking new cards and building your own decks to compete competitivley against other people or AI is such an appealing concept to me, the game seems so basic but its so effective. The graphics, the mechanics of the game and even the sounds just all work. Its one of those games were a win feels so satisfying and i loss is irritating but it doesnt make me want to quit, it just encourages me to play more, get some new cards, re-work my deck to amend the errors ive made before, plus there is the option to BUY packs for cards but it is in no means neccesary, this game is no were near a pay to win, its just an option if you want to progress and tiny bit quicker, but the rate of unlocking cards just by playing the game is very quick anyway.  ok so some details on how the game works as such:  There are 5 legends (Characters) and each one has their own special skill set e.g. Blacksmith, Mage, Tank and they have cards that are specific to them, the rest of the deck is made up of general cards that any legend has access too. So you create your deck in a way you feel is best for the way you play, wether you like to play very agressive throughout the chapters or if you like to build your stats up ready for the final fight (ill get to this bit soon)  once your deck has been made youre are now ready to go, you can start of playing against the AI (reccomeded for practice) on three levels; Bronze, Silver &amp; Gold, rewards are still picked up for beating AI opponents. You can also play Casual matches, these are just like 'friendly' matches against online players to 'test your decks and skill' (as said in game) and finally there is the Ranked Matches. You start off in Bronze Division, get 10 wins and you move to silver, Silver division you need 25 to gold and these go up through Gold and then finally to Platinum. Although it sounds simple to say 'well i only need to win 25 games? easy' yes it may be, but when you lose again, you essientally lose a win, making winning the games that much more important.  now onto the gameplay. Each match consits of 5 Chapters and at the end of the 5th chapter is the final fight, within each chapter both players can play a maximum of 4 cards. Cards are dealt at the begginging of the game, each player is handed 6 cards from their deck and can decide if they want to swap any cards for another in their deck, then it is decided who will go 1st and who will go 2nd, those who are picked 2nd are given 1 extra card to start. Now that the cards have been dealt the game is ready to start. Each player has a 'Stats Bar', these show your Weapon Stats (Attack/Durability) shown as a fraction, your base attack (which is what your character will hit as without a weapon, shown as a number in fire), The amount of gold you have (obviously shown as a number in gold coins), your health (Shown as a number inside a heart, which is maxed at 30) and finally your armour (Shown as a number inside a shield). All of these stats will change depending on the cards that are played during the game and ultimately having an effect on the final fight, if you are still alive for it.  At the end of Chapter 5, you and your opponent battle it out, no cards, just you and your stats. The stats that you had gathered or lost throughout the 5 chapters are all used here. If you end Chapter 5 with (2 Base attack, 1 Gold, 12 Health, 3 Armour) then that is what you take into the fight, so it is important that through the chapters you give yourself the best chance of winning the fight based on your stats against your opponents (Note. it is possible to defeat your oppenent during the chapters and the game finishing there without the need of a final fight)  When the fight is over (After one of you has hit their animated final hit) the match has ended and you will have been victorious or defeated, either way you will still earn XP, just the amounts vary from the outcome and with this you will earn cards and coins which can be used for packs or to play the dungoneering feature.  I havent played the dungeoneering feature much so i cant go into much detail but its essientally a drafting system. You start the dungeon (after paying the 1500 copper coins entry fee, free for first time players) and are welcomed with a screen of 2 random legends and you have to pick one. Once you have decided on the legend you wish to play as there are then 15 'Draft Rounds' in which you pick 2 cards out of a possible 5 to create your deck. Once the 15 rounds are complete and your deck is ready you will enter the dungeon in room 1. You are then put against an online player in a match, the winner of that match progresses through to the next room, aswell as a reward for each room complete. If you lose the game you have 3 lives to complete the dungeon so losing the first match isnt a major issue, it is still possible to go on and complete all the room, in which i think, although dont quote me on it, that there is 12 rooms in total, At the end of the 12th room there is a big prize.  I think that this is pretty much all i have to say, alot of it i know, but i thought i'd be good to give a full explanation for those who are unsure wether to download and to be honest, its a free to play game, if you dont like it then your no worse of, other than a few GB of memory on your hard-drive,  I hope you found the review helpful, and enjoy playing.

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"I've played every Grand Theft Auto since the PSX releases. I even had the GBC version at one point. GTA5 is the most fully realized entry to date. The scope of the game, although not as big as GTA San Andreas, still contains a lot of depth and detail that I didn't realize was lacking in previous entries. Both the single player and online component includes a lot of different activities to get into and there's never a shortage of mayhem to engage in considering the creator mode's inclusion. Highly recommend.  Update 11/23: I'm hearing of a few people getting permabanned for things beyond players control. This is NOT good, Rockstar.",1,0

281990,Stellaris,"I've been playing this game for 11 hours now, over the course of 2 play sessions. TLDR - I love it, buy it, it's amazing and well worth the price!  I'm still very much in the exploration phase of the game, founding new colonies, meeting other empires and exploring with my science ships. I've been running the game at normal speed with the odd pause to catch up, and there is never a time when nothing is going on and I feel bored.  I know there have been some complaints about the research system. Basically you get to pick from a small number (never less than 3) projects to research. These projects are weighted by what you have just unlocked and your progress in the game. So there is a loose tech tree of sorts, but you aren't limited by a set tech tree like say, Civ V, where you know what is coming and quickly build an optimal path that will be repeated with every play though. With the Stellaris system there is no obvious path to follow and it more realistically follows real discoveries, where scientist look for funding to work on a project. More importantly it keeps the game fresh and very repayable.  As to the depth, another complaint. I keep finding whole new game systems I haven't really encountered yet. Planetary armies and air forces, multi-species empires, the list goes on. For espionage, I imagine that is something that will come with DLC.  Oh, the Paradox DLC model. Sure they really crank out the DLC for their games, but they match that with a low entry price. $39 in a market where many games cost #60. Even if you don't buy the DLC it always comes with a free patch with many new systems, expanding the game at no additional cost.  I've been a big Paradox fan since CK2 and this is a great additional to the grand strategy family. Recommended.  ",1,0

244210,Assetto Corsa,"After enjoying racing sims for the past seven years AC will hopefully keep the enjoyment coming. I'm very keen on seeing how the multi-player turns out and how strong the league scene will be. I much prefer league racing over pick up racing ( iRacing official series / open servers ) as league racing tends to be a lot cleaner. As i can only really do one night a week for league racing ( work reasons ) I am also hoping for a good single player experiece.  From the few hours I've spent on AC I'm very impressed with how the cars handle, especially at low speed corners where some sims behave very enexpectedly. Any mishap is clearly a 'oh I did this or that wrong' not a 'WTF' moment.  Graphics wise i have no problems getting 90FPS running triple monitors with a GTX680 at moderate settings. Hopefully AC will still do more optimizing so when we have multiple cars on track the frames won't take a nose dive.  All in all I'm impressed with what I've seen so far and infact have gifted AC to one of my sim racing friends.  edit: In fact make that gifted to two friends. Feeling a bit like Santa",1,0
239140,Dying Light,"So I first got this game thinking it was going to be like any zombie game exept with crappy parkour and very unstable and buggy addons. But I was wrong! The parkour is very fluent and has a very nice pace to it. When it turns night thats when the parkour really comes into play because there are many dangerous things about night. The volitiles is one of them. They are exreamely strong and know p[arkour. You want to take complicated routes and try to escape them if the see you. The gun play is kinda crappy because they dont feel like they belong in the game but if you get a rifle the only major use is to kill bolters and volitiles at night. The melee play is gorgeous. There are so many creative ways to kill a zombie and you are always exited to try some out when you unlock them in the skill tree which leads to my next thing to talk about. The skill trees divide into 3 different ones. Sorvivor which you get sorvivor points for helping people out, completing missions, and saving sorvivors or dropping of airdrops. Agility is basically what it sounds like, for parkour. Then there is combat which I LOVE. Everytime you unlock a new way to kill a zombie or a person, you always want to try it out right away. Overall a great game and I adore it. 10/10",1,0

292570,Chompy Chomp Chomp,"  Not a masterpiece or anything, but this is a pretty fun little arcade game.  Singleplayer is entertaining and a good time waster of simply trying to beat your high scores. The basis of the game is running from a big Blobbidee and eating small Blobbidees, but you can only eat creatures that share the same color as you. You can swap colors on the fly and need to switch colors and chain-eat enemies within the time limit. After each round you get a small boost to the time limit for the next round, but it becomes progressively more difficult to quickly switch colors, rush to eat, and avoid the larger Blobbidee that is following you.   Local multiplayer is where this game shines though, as it is sort of a PvP pac man. The game supports up to four players (though you can play the arena mode against AI if you want) and each player has a different color in appearance. Everyone is assigned a different target, and they can only eat the target they are assigned to. The chaotic bit is running from the player chasing you while also trying to chase down another player.  This isn't groundbreaking gamplay and the game has simple visuals, but it is fun as a little arcade game. The $7 price tag isn't worth it though, as this seems more of a $1-2 type of game. I did get a copy of this in a giveaway and will gladly spend some time with friends/family in the local multiplayer when the chance comes around and it is a good little game to have at the ready in my library.",1,0

Lacks the progression system of the afformentioned titles however which it makes it kind of hollow, if you want to spend a little cash you can buy the 'Best' ships right off the bat, but learning how to fight them takes some more pratice.

290490,The Flock,"I can in no way recommend this game. EDIT: In case people judge this review by my playtime, I've seen everything there is to the game. I played all maps, played both creatures, toyed around with all the abilities and mechanics all in a whopping 30 minutes. If that doesn't say something about the content in the game I don't know anymore.  There's no sense of actually accomplishing anything. You just run around as flock, grab whoever is holding the torch thing and run shining your light at balls until you get killed yourself. That's all there is to it. Additionally there is only 3 maps from which 1 is fairly big and the 2 other rather small.  Matches can take as little time as 5 minutes and are not exciting at all.  It actually looks like the developers were so excited about the concept of killing off the game when a certain amount of people die that they actually forgot to put content in the game, or bother fixing whatever 'content' that's already in because there's several bugs ranging from flock getting launched up in the air to text issues.

227380,Dragon's Lair,"I used to remember trying to play this game in the arcades back in the 80s. It, along with Fire Fox, were the two big laser discs based games back at the time. They were also more expensive per play than most games. I bought this mainly for nostalgia reasons and to see if I could finally get to the end, which I have never seen.   Well, it still plays like utter crap. The game should be called 'Quick Time Lair'. You have to hit the arrow keys or spacebar at PRECISELY the momement the game wants you to or else....POOF! You're dead. Moreoever, there are only a limited number of rooms/scenes to be encountered, and you will see most (if not all?) of them played one way, then show up later in a mirror image of moves that need to be done.   Most unforgiveable is that the game is not remasted in full HD. On my system, it only filled about 2/3 of the upper left of the screen, and playing it in a window did not help any either - the image stayed in the upper left portion of the window also.

The idea of playing this game as a pacifist is a good one, but it's a shame that SO MUCH of the game centers around escaping armed forces firing on you with automatic weapons where your only recourse is to forcibly remove the weapons at point blank range using precisely timed maneuvers or running away while taking hits. There's a missed opportunity here for a true freerunning experience if the devs hed deemed players capable of choosing alternate paths and seeing different components as options instead of requirements. Halfway through and I've given up because of the 'difficulty' scaling focuing entirely on how fast enemies shoot at you instead of making the environment more complex.",-1,0

The little Lizard Raga walks, shoots, turns, scoots and everything else right on cue. Its one of those rare games where if you die, its your own dang fault.  Level layout is great too, viewed from a near top down (Isaac style). Theres so many dead ends that can lead to certain death or a ton of gold, or maybe even a weapon upgrade. The thrill of finding one of your favorite weapons in a random chest after a tough room is amazing. In my case finding a trident makes my run instantly better.  I absolutely love the whole 'you die and get a second chance as an angel lizard while you can be resurrected and keep going'-bit. I also really like the fact that the ghosts of all your slain enemies can come back to haunt you the spirit world! Making you choose between disturbing the dead and possibly get more money, or letting them rest in peace and have fewer enemies when you die.. cause you will. A lot.

305640,Shattered Planet,"Going in blind only to find one of the most unique roguelikes I've ever played.   Story: 7.5/10 The story is interesting and new for a roguelike. You are a clone generated on some sort of space station. You teleport to planets on a quest to scour and repair these  shattered planets . You also have an alien scientist that helps you learn and explain the situation along the way -- I don't want to ruin any of it. xD  Gameplay: 8/10 All you need is a mouse to control this game, and it's incredibly functional. There are multiple types of classes to choose from, at first just the Renegade and the Assassin. Each planet you travel to has increasing 'distances' or levels, that each get harder, to collect items, scrap, and crystals. You mostly use scrap to level up stats and crystals to craft or buy items. You can also recycle items for scrap. You move around and attack by clicking, with only two equipment slots -- a helmet and a weapon. Your inventory can consist of health items, projectiles and potions.  Graphics: 8/10 An appetizing take on graphics choice for this type of isometric view. It's very reminiscent of something like Shadowrun, but a little more cartoonish. The different sprites for customizing your clone is very dynamic as well. Definitely a unique style.  Sound: 6.5/10 The atmospheric music fits the game well, but for a game with a pace like this I'd expect a little more action in the soundtrack. Still the mood of the music is so very appropriate for the melancholy of the worlds you're immersed in. The sound effects are a little repetitive and could be expanded upon as well.  Overall: 7.5/10 A solid game with  lots  of replayability and character customization. For any fan of roguelikes this is definitely a title you need to pick up and take a look at for a slightly different take on the genre. I think with maybe a few DLC releases, possibly some new music and weapons/armor/worlds, this could become a definite standout game. You won't be disappointed in this title.",1,1

During their travel, they meet with several unique character, one of them will be joining the travel at the late game, it's about adventure and friendship.......... but don't you ever think that this visual novel is about adventure and friendship, there's a twist that going to turn this visual novel into one of hell a f*cked up story, it become 'race against time' and 'friendship or life'. The world in this Visual Novel is really interesting, The world is divided into two, Place where people believe in Science and People that believe in Magic(It almost like Western and Eastern). Our character is from Magic World and they teleported to Sceience World, there's a lot of the scene revolve in Culture Shock Topic and many of the conversation is about difference between science and magic socienty.  Character : 8/10 ========================================== Character in this Visual Novel is interesting and Likeable, every character is developed really well and they always have something unexpected that we cannot predict (like the ending where Selphine is..... ah spoiler :^) ) Just be prepared for mind blowing reveal about the character. the only bad part in fault is not all introduced character is presented in the story especially the antagonist, the one who invade the castle at the prologue *Melano best grill  ========================================== Art/Grapich : 10/10 ========================================== Stunning and Beautiful, the UI is minimalist but it doesn't mean it's bad, in fact, it's really good and fit the game. Character design is really good, Charaters sprites and CG is drawn pretty well (oh~ waifus!!!). This Visual Novel use unique 3D Camera system for immersive reading experience, to be honest it's not really immersive but it does give interesting reading experience and give more cinematic feel to the novel.  ========================================== Music/Sound : 10/10 ========================================== 4 words : Absolutely.beautiful.worth.buy It just f*ckin good to listen. too bad the game is not voiced (yes, it's not voiced)  ========================================== Enjoyment : 10/10 ========================================== I really enjoy this visual novel, honestly i'm not fans of fantasy genre but this one is exception for me because the story is really good. Well, maybe this Visual Novel is fulfill my need for fanfic about fantasy and sci-fi world.   ========================================== CONCLUSION ========================================== I recommended this Visual Novel, especially.... when you're into To Aru series (Index/Railgun), the premise is little bit similar except the time setting is different (To Aru = Modern Age, fault = Medieval age, or Late Medieval). Story : Check Twist : Check Music : Check Art : Check Character : Check Enjoyment : Check What are you waiting for, READ IT!!

292730,Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare,"I feel most of the hate towards this game is because of a 'bandwagon' or a 'trend' people started and people decide to just follow the trends. Here's my honest review.  Zombies... A Treyarch favourite gamemode re-designed to an Infinity Ward design. Its great, I've played 30+ hours on the single map yet i still enjoy it every time. Its got great mechanics, plays well, has lots to do and is just bloody fun. The map and character and overall design of the entire mode is great and I havn't come across any flaws yet. Its a great game for zombies, especially when you're playing with mates.  Multiplayer... Thrust jumping and wallrunning returns. It dosn't feel AS powerful as black ops III or advanced warfare, but I still find those people who hold jump and shoot and fly around the map. I usually play boots on the ground and use the thrusters as an 'aid' to get to the action faster or reach a high ledge. There is a good amount of combat rigs to play around with, some feel a bit unbalanced but everything has its counter. The customization and 'social' system is pretty fun and the supply drops aren't like the bo3 ones. Overall its a 'fun' multiplayer, but the shotgun/smg rushers get annoying.  Campaign... Havn't touched the campaign yet, from what I've seen and heard it seems good, and can't wait to try it.  In summary, its a great game, I agree we've gone 'too far' into the 'future' but its fun. We're all here to have fun right? So to that kid who actually got butthurt abusing me because I purcahsed this, have fun on your 'last gen' games that nobody plays anymore ^^",1,1

368230,Kingdom: Classic,"So far I've read a lot of reviews that say the game is frustrating and or stupid/boring. I'm writing this to respond to those reviews and maybe offer a point of view that looks at the issues with the game from a different angle.  First of all the Pro &amp; Cons:  Pros: - Visually gorgeous. - Great music and sound design. - Engaging and amusing game design.  Cons: - Die and retry. Make a mistake, die, go back and figure out why you died. Die again. - Lack of depth. You'll probably get less than 10 hours out of the game before you've done everything and it just becomes achievement grinding.  Now let's look at why the cons up close.  The game suffers from that whole purist 'no tuto, learn how to play yourself you lazy ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥' thing that seems to be sweeping the indieverse at the moment. But the problem with this is that it's an artificial way of lengthening the play time of the game.  Essentially the mechanics of the game are simple, like really, really simple. I've seen people complaining about how 'the castle only gives you one coin at max level so everything takes so long.... whinge whinge', well folks if you believe that, you haven't got it. In fact you probably suck at games and should go back to banging your head against the bars of your cage and drooling.  Once you have actually understood how it works though, you can beat the game in like, 2 hours. So if you're the type of person who likes to read guides or watch videos, you're not going to get a lot of time out of the game. If you're not this type of person and you just want to 'figure it out', you're gonna die. A lot. This approach makes the game seem slow, repetitive and even boring.  So all in all, it's a great simple little game that's fun to play and worth every cent if you get it on sale. Just don't expect some epically long game with tons of replayability.",1,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,SO MUCH WASTED POTENTIAL The game on the offical low level servers it self isnt too bad and offers a mildly entertaining mostley sheltered expierence. Once you leave that server then welcome the complete exploitation of the real combat mechanics. This game is all about the drag which in its played out form is exploiting the combat mechanics if it wasnt the characters wouldnt look like they are doing circles and having seziures. If you want to get any where in the combat then you must learn to use and abuse this. Throw in the occasional speed hacker and a good dose of players that seem to have drunk a magical potion that gives them never ending stamina and this game certainly isnt for me. My experiecne with this game also doesnt lead me to belive that the community that plays it helps it in any way either. Overall save you money folks,-1,0

240760,Wasteland 2,"This game has its issues and bugs like any other game that is as big as this does. You can't make a game this massive and expect it to be perfect no matter how much time and skill you put in to it. There's just so much to factor in, so many different ways to approach any situation. I've played through this once on another account and I had to buy it for this one. Takes a lot of time just to get started because you will most likely rebuild your squad multiple times trying to find what works best for you. I recommend doing some research on the stats an what functionable builds are out there and build a squad according to what you find yourself. Tons of game play, wonderful way to spend your spare time. This game is not super fast paced if you don't want it to be but you can also just plow through the story if that is what you want. You have tons of options to play the way you want although you have to use combat as effectively as possible no matter what kind of character development you go for. Combat is literally this game. Most of the game is spent reading text into the story or fighitng in turn based combat.",1,0

281640,The Banner Saga 2,"As someone who was obsessed with Valkyria Chronicles and both XCOM 1 and 2, I love this game and the orginal. I would say its one of my favorite games of the past 10 years.   At first I was skeptical of the combat as it lacks verticality, taking cover, and all the different ways to attack or defend in XCOM. But they're very different games. To me The Banner Saga, and this sequel, are more like chess. It seems like the developers are telling you, 'use your special power at the right time. Plan ahead. Make them use more attacks, while you take less'.  My only criticism is the dialog options. The series has always made me feel like I'm blindly chosing these. If I'm playing as Rook for instance, and I've been reading all his lines, and understand how he would respond, I should be rewarded when I pick the humble yet reluctant leader option. Instead, sometimes the best option/the one that doesn't get a character killed, is the out of left field one. Basically, the dialog makes me feel like I'm flipping a coin. It's like an old school point and click adventure, and that's not a compliment.   When the birth of indie games happened a few years ago, and we got Braid, Castle Crashers and Bastion, we then witnessed this wave with everyone and their mother making an indie game hoping it would be the next big hit. This is one that should be. Buy this game.",1,0

374320,DARK SOULS™ III,"If you've never played a Dark Souls game before, this is a great one to start with.   PROS: First things first; I say its a good start, because it is the easiest in the series. The motions are fluid, if a bit restrictive (once you play it, you understand what i mean), the graphics are amazing, the game is REALY well optimized, and, true to form, this game will make you want to play more, even as you have your a$$ handed to you. Even the first boss is a nice tutorial into the game. The enemies are a for the most part predictable, but dont let that fool you. Almost every enemy has one move that looks like another, but attacks at different times, which can make parrying and dodging a bit difficult if you don't pay attention.   CONS: OFFLINE: One of the major cons per gameplay is the F***ING CAMERA! it can go haywire at the most inopportune moments, which in a game series known for difficulty, can screw you over fast. TIP: You can rely on the camera but always be aware of your surroundings. If the enemy goes out of lock and you can't see him, it helps to know where he probably is and to know where the escape routes are.   Poise is basically nonexistant in this game compared to the others. With the heaviest armor (tested with a few invasions for authenticity) you will still flinch with the weakest weapon hit. Armor is basically just to help get another 2-3% damage reduction, which admittedly CAN mean the difference between crouching over and dying and surviving with a couple hit points.  The worst aspect of this game is by far the anti-cheating system in place to 'protect' online players from hackers. You can only realy expect the anti cheating sytem to work on people who were HIT with hacked weapons or people who PICK UP hacked weapons that other players drop. Trust me, the anti cheating system is the BIGGEST F*** YOU to honest players I have ever seen. Oh yeah, and just so I dont forget to say it, the anti cheating system will PERMA BAN you. Not for a week, not for a month, not for a year, FOREVER.   Now although the cons might seem to outweigh the pros, I will still recomend this to people. The hackers, do seems to be dwindiling in numbers now that the game has been out for a while, and I personally love the game and gameplay far too much to just stop. My only suggestion is that, until FROM fixes the cheat problem to something much more manageable, THIS GAME IS NOT WORTH FULL PRICE. It is worth a buy , but wait till you can get everything for about 40 bucks (DLC INCLUDED). Once they fix the cheating system then I will say that it is worth full price.",1,0

406550,Umineko When They Cry - Question Arcs,"I read Umineko years ago as the VNs were coming out and witchhunt translated them. I can't recommend it enough, this series of novels is truly amazing, and imo surpasses Higurashi in terms of characters and plot. It's mystery aspect is quite interesting, and if you like and Then There Were None, you'll enjoy this since Umineko is heavily inspired by Agatha Christie's novel. Fantasy elements are also an interesting addition to the general mystery format, and Battler's battle to disprove Beatrice's existance is great to read (especially in the later episodes). If you want to experience it the best way, I'd recommend waiting for the inevitable PS3 patch, since the art is more consitant, but overall it's worth the money. Hopefully the other 4 novel's get their release as well, after replaying the question arcs my itch to finish the story has increased, and the new art style has also grown on me quite a bit.

No Necrons, Imperial Guard or Tau, on multiplayer, even if you already bought those games which still advertise this as a selling point.

252950,Rocket League,"Let’s not waste energy exploring why soccer should replace its paper chain of squalid billionaires with cars, and accept it as fact. A fact which Rocket League proves with simple and immediate ease.  I’ve never played a game that needed a tutorial less. Association football, soccer, wendyball; whatever you want to call it, it’s that, but on wheels. Drive car at giant ball; hit ball into net; score points. Rocket League’s competitive core has existed for centuries, and this helps make a preposterous concept feel primal. This, in turn, is a laughable way of describing a game which would be called moto carball if it actually existed.  Like dry martinis and ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ scribbled in an unattended notebooks, Rocket League is a celebration of simplicity. Driving is delicious. Cars ease around like butter in a heated pan, but always feel under your control. You accumulate boost by driving over markers on the arena floor and unleash it is a thunderous rush that fires you across, over and around the pitch. Because matches take place in smooth, enclosed spaces, you can drive up walls and across ceilings. Cars can also jump and dodge, both of which can be used defensively and offensively. The weight of the cars, as well as your ability to apply unruly boost to jumps, adds a pleasingly haphazard element; like athletic footballers leaping to header high balls, but with less shirt-pulling and zero chance of flattening a £2000 hairdo.  Cars ease around like butter in a heated pan, but always feel under your control. Vehicles feel light and buzzy—somewhere between Micro Machines, and those swift, slidey remote controlled cars which only seem to appear on Christmas Day. This contrasts nicely with the fat, beefy bounce of the ball, which gormlessly invites impact like a punchable cousin. And that’s it. I feel almost guilty reducing a review to ‘ball’ and ‘car’, but there are only ever those two things in the field of play, and crucially, they both feel great. It’s helped by a crisp, intuitive camera. You can focus on the ball, effortlessly whizzing around with it always in view, or switch to the standard camera - very useful for rushing back to defend your goal, or smashing into other vehicles. There are no weapons, but certain markers fill your boost and let you obliterate other players. Mercifully, it’s the generous, instantly-respawning type of obliteration. Destruction is the only conspicuous deviation from clean business of driving around and scoring goals, but in most of the games I played it was a rarity—certainly never frequent enough to be irritating.  Destroying other vehicles is one of many actions which accumulates points; imagine Burnout, but with awards for skill not speed. You receive points for things like clearing the ball from your goal line, spectacular saves and overhead bicycle kicks—named so because the more literal ‘quadracycle wheel-nudge’ is a senseless stew of words. Giving everything a points value means it’s about more than scoring goals. The most valuable players I encountered were workmanlike wingers who selflessly chugged along the the flanks, crossing the ball for greedy goalhunters like me. It stops players from clustering in the same spots and reinforces the concept that Rocket League is a team game.    Except, of course, when it’s not, such as when you’re duelling against a single opponent. Alternatively, you can set teams of four against each other, in matches which become so frantic that they’re less like footy, more like a lost, confused beach ball bashed between bumper cars. Playlists of duels, doubles, standard 3v3 matches and the appropriately named Chaos 4v4 mode are all available online, with ranked playlists limited to duels, doubles and 3v3. There’s a reason why online play is the first option on the menu: Rocket League is designed to be played with actual people, and this is absolutely where it thrives. My experience was marvellously robust. I rarely had to wait long for a game, and if players dropped out mid-session they were immediately replaced by AI bots. Best of all, it’s refreshingly simple to get back into another game, so very little time is spent lingering in lobbies.  If playing online isn’t your thing, there are exhibition matches and full seasons you can solo. The length and difficulty can be altered, and while it doesn’t offer much in the way of depth—cars and football, remember?—I still found myself bonding with pretend teammates. Whether online or offline, playing games randomly unlocks new cars and upgrades. These range from simple things like fresh coats of paint and shiny wheels, to pointy hats for your wizardmobile. Upgrades are purely cosmetic, but volume, variety and the promise of driving around with bubbles frothing from your exhaust should be enough to keep you coming back.  The offline modes do reveal the game’s minor inadequacies, however: team AI can be flaccid and unreliable, especially against tougher opponents, and the same simplicity which makes Rocket League immediately playable can cause things to get repetitive when played alone; a criticism that only becomes apparent precisely because it’s so damn addictive. It’s a simple thing done brilliantly well, kept interesting by the thrill of competition.  THE VERDICT  87/100 ROCKET LEAGUE Rocket League is fast, fun and relentlessly enjoyable. The best football game without feet.",1,0

209000,Batman™: Arkham Origins,"If you really feel the need to play this, grab it while it's on sale.  The pacing is off and doesn't really help to drive the story forward in any compelling way, barring one or two short exceptions.  Nearly all of the design is lifted from its predecessors, and then poorly implemented in this new outing. Gotham city feels claustrophobic. There are no civilians to speak of, just 100% roving gangs, and the city manages to feel drearily devoid of life. The layouts of the internal areas are re-used repeatedly, only changing a little window dressing and adding enemies who are more annoying than the previous revision of that room.  SIde missions are repetitive and feel tacked-on. The banter between riddler and batman feels forced, and makes it almost painful to keep trophy hunting.  The Mr Freeze DLC they had the audacity to charge for is an exact dupe of the boss fight from Arkham City. Strongly recommend you avoid this DLC if you've already played Arkham City.  I really can't recommend this game, unless you're in an extreme drought. At that point, if you go in with lowered expectations, you should be able to get a few good hours out of the decent combat and the one or two flashes of inspiration that this game has.",-1,0

And even with all the eye candy turned on this game really doesnt look that great(in context for the year it came out). It reminds me of WoW which isnt saying much. The story is somewhat interesting but the side quests are boring and some are downright tedious. The combat system has potential to but is let down by a poorly thought out skill system and all the other issues I previously mentioned.  Its to bad.

306660,Ultimate General: Gettysburg,"Let me say upfront that I enjoy UG:G quite a bit. I hadn't played a Civil War strategy game in many years, not since the classic American Civil War, published by iMagic (who, amazingly enough, are actually still around, unlike most of their contemporaries). This game, though, was developed by the indie company Game-Labs. If you want to know upfront if I'd recommend this game, the answer is yes, with just one caveat - although the tutorial is adequate, its still pretty basic, and the online guide is missing some things, as well. So, if you really don't like having to work some things out on your own, or consult Steam guides, you might give it a pass.  Now, for some more detailed Pros and Cons:  PROS  - Strong presentation. There's not much music, but the opening/title screen theme is nice, and the sound effects in gameplay are realistic. The portraits for the different generals, colonels, majors, etc. are all well-done, and aren't just lifts of old black-and-white photos. The map is very nice, quite accurate and detailed.  - The AI is very good, and comes with a lot of customization - there are nine, different AI settings, based on aggressiveness and difficulty, and you can mix and match to create your desired strength of opposition. There is also a Boost AI setting that can be enabled, though I have yet to be brave enough for that.  - You can tell that the designer is knowledgeable about both Civil War and Gettysburg history. I just recently finished Gettysburg by Allen C. Guelzo, and UG:G gets almost everything correct.  - Branching scnarios - let's say you're playing as the Union, and you manage to hold onto the northern ridges in town through the first day, instead of losing them to the Confederates as per history. This will prompt the game to give you options for your next strategy - launch an attack on a Confederate position, or withdraw to the southern ridges. If you choose to extend your right flank with an attack on the Confederates and succeed, this will then also lead to additional, non-historical scenarios. This is also true for the other side, but I have only played as the Union forces so far.  - Replay value - you would think that a single-battle game might not have much, but I've been through it several times now; partially to see if I can score a more decisive victory than was recorded in history, and partly because I haven't done as well as I would like to, and want to achieve better results. The different, branching paths, plus the possibility of a Pyrrhic victory (winning the battle but losing too many troops) are strong motivators to play some more.  CONS  - Although the branching scenarios are great, sometimes they can be a bit perplexing. For example, as the Union, I secured part of the map that historically had been lost on the first day of fighting. While this did lead to the branching paths described above, the text briefings indicated that I'd had to reteat to Seminary ridge anyway. While losing the ground outright does not result in an option to launch an attack to take it back, such that your strong performance still results in a change of sorts, it would be nice if all of the scenarios branched directly off the actual results. Most do, but some don't. I suspect this disconnect comes from trying to create alt-history divergences that still fit into the original scope of the battle. It's not a huge problem, but it's somewhat disarming.  - Some aspects of gameplay, while fully revealed during the course of play, are not explicitly mentioned in the tutorial. Artillery fire, for example. When you select an artillery unit, you'll get an FOV cone and can click on enemies within the unit's FOV to attack. If the FOV cone is darkened, rather than bright, that means the unit has no line of sight. Likewise, if you click on an enemy unit to attack, and it simply flashes briefly but does not remain highlighted in red, that unit is not within your artillery unit's line of sight. No line of sight = no firing. When you click on a unit that is within your line of sight, the enemy soldiers are highlighted in red, not just for a moment. If you click over somewhere else and come back to your artillery unit, it's targeted enemy will still show up in red highlights. These are the visual cues that tell you whether your artillery is placed correctly so that it will attack the enemy, but you have to figure them out through gameplay rather than being told explictly. Honestly, I expect to spend a lot of time with a strategy game, learning, so it's not a big gripe on my end.  Overall, I think this is a very good game, with good presentation, good historical accuracy, nice design, branching scenarios and most importantly, it's a lot of fun. There are a couple of issues that may render it unsuitable for some, depending on their preferences, but I think that most Civil War enthusiasts will enjoy it.",1,0

Main character Max is likable person...they should give little more attention to side characters too!

Some areas will be more populated than others, and the amount of people online varies with time of day But thats any MMO... But unlike other MMOs, I can go for hours without feeling like I'm running into other players.  Player idle animations (when other players are looking at their inventory or quest log) look like adventures searching through back packs or reading books. I really liked this touch.    If you are looking to feel emersed in the Elder Scrolls universe, but hate MMO over crowding and text walls. ESO is the game for you. (All quests are voice acted!!). Camera perspective plays out just like other Elder Scroll games  If you are looking for a great MMO that moves away from boring grinding, then ESO is the MMO you been waiting for :D Quests progress you at a good pace, and some quests will even scale with you. So you feel challenged but not too under powered (or vice versa).    Elder scrolls online is an amazing game. Nothing comes close to the experience I want out of an MMO than ESO.",1,1

250320,The Wolf Among Us,"To start: If you want a little more detail on my reviewing ethos, go to my Backloggery page. I've left it there to make these reviews not as long.  Gameplay: If you've played The Walking Dead, you can come to expect a lot of the same from this game on the Gameplay front. Disappointingly, though, there weren't any actual puzzles that come to mind right off the bat. Apart from that, there's a lot more QTEs this time around as opposed to the first Walking Dead game. Fortunately, they're not as harsh as The Walking Dead's, so if you found yourself dying a couple of times on that game, odds are that you won't die here. It could make playing this game on a laptop tricky, however, so keep that in mind. Apart from that, there really isn't much else to go on about here. Again, I would've liked to have seen some actual puzzles in this game. Ah well; the QTEs do at least liven up the cinematics. 7/10.  Story: For the longest time, I was sure that this was finally the original IP we have been looking for out of the modern Telltale Adventure Game iterations. However, it turns out that this is based off of the Fables comic series. I haven't read the comics, but I didn't really ever feel like I needed to. You'll probably have questions if you're new to this series, but those questions do get answered in good time. Apart from that, it's once again more of what you'd come to expect from a Telltale game. You get to make a lot of decisions in how the game plays out, and most of the choices do have consequences for the story. The ending wasn't quite as blockbusting as the Walking Dead Season 1's ending, but it was satisfying nonetheless. In fact, I think that's the tagline you could use to talk about this game's story, 'It's not as good as The Walking Dead, but you'll have a pretty dang good time nonetheless.' 9/10.  Graphics: I'm sure I don't need to tell you this, but this game looks utterly fantastic. It's a lot more neon-washed than The Walking Dead, but that's just because The Walking Dead needed to be bleak looking. In fact, another step up from The Walking Dead is that there wasn't a single graphical glitch throughout the whole playthrough for me. As far as the technical aspect, it initially fullscreened to 1024x768, but once I dug into the options menu a little bit, I was able to change it to 1080p without a hassle. I still don't get why so many games don't have an autodetect resolution function, but it's not too big of a deal. You don't need too beefy of a graphics option for this game, and I'd imagine that the Intel HD Graphics chip could handle this without an issue. Once again, an example of how art style can beat the hell out of high polygon counts anyday. 5/5.  Sound: We'll start off with the voiceacting here, and I've gotta say; Telltale sure is good at picking voice actors. There really wasn't a line throughout the game that made me feel like the actor was hamming it up, so that's all well and good. Fun fact: Bluebeard and Lee Everett share the same voice actor. So yeah, the voice acting is as stellar as one would expect from a Telltale game. As far as the music goes, a lot of it is atmospheric and not necessarily something you'd want to listen to outside of the game. Of course, though, like a lot of atmospheric pieces, the goal of the song is to set the mood, which they do a fantastic job at. The main theme that plays on the opening credits of each episode does a fantastic job of summing up the mood of the game. Overall, the sound design is once again excellent, and will most likely not disappoint you. Much like I've said in the rest of this review, don't expect this game to beat The Walking Dead. Expect it to be close, though. 5/5.  Overall scores are: 7/9/5/5; cumulative score of 8.7/10. Not quite a five star game, but it's close. Damn close. I'd say it's worth the money, though.",1,0

383870,Firewatch,"This isn't a video game. This is a movie that you click through. There is no skill involved, there are no mechanics to master or techniques to learn. The only thing relatively interesting about this game is the early parts of it's plot and (spoiler) the reveal and end of it is absolutely shenanigans.  I feel like this piece of media has third-wave, talk about your feelings, feminist academia philosophy all strewn all through it and it didn't give me any sense of accomplishment or pride to say that I clicked through what basically amounted to a storyboard with voices.  It looks ok, but the repetitive nature of the things you have to do in order to get from place to place quickly lose what little appeal they had in the originality of the character movement. There are no puzzles to solve, it literally requires no brain power to get through, and it almost mocks you with multiple saves at the front and a restart day option in the esc in game menu that gives you a glimmer of hope that you might die and the game might actually be challenging.    I have only played through it once, and still allowing for the fact that there could be different iterations of the plot depending on the dialogue choices I make (which btw are at max three per interaction, i don't remember there ever being four) it left me with such little joy that I don't want to experience it and will be googling it shortly after writing this to see if it's even a thing.   I am almost positive that the only reason this game is as popular as it is is that it gave basement-dwelling neckbeards a small connection to a female voice actress that seemingly cared about the in-game player, and it got them through another hour and a half of their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ ♥♥♥ life.

104700,Super Monday Night Combat,"This would be a great game, but... it has too many negative aspects to it. There is a significant lack of players within the game that actually want to play some MNC and have a good round of something. It's very rare to find a decent game of Crossfire or Turbocross (the 2 VS Modes) and still have an enjoyable time. You're most likely find yourself playing a round of the Tower Defense-esque game mode in a small group. Or alone.  When you do find a good Cross game you might enjoy, the Free 2 Players are at a staggering disadvantage. People who pay real money for upgrades, perks, and special equipment have some great advantages against the non-Premium players.  This was going to be a good game, but it was a disappointment.",-1,0
323470,DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE,"After now putting over 45 hours into the game, my opinion has changed somewhat.. there are points to the game that could be addressed as below.. but in general it is a very nice little arcade fighting game.. Especially for a DBZ fan, every single character feels different and there are countless skills to learn.. I am around 50-60% complete of the whole game, level 80 on my custom character and unlocked every single character.. and i am wanting more.. i will be buying the season pass..  There are alot of people with 3-4 hours gameplay giving this crazy high ratings so here is my opinion  Pros",1,0

Your first few tries will end with everyone either starving to death or freezing to death. It punishes and it punishes hard. You can build a huge sprawling city then it can all go wrong and they will all starve to death in the winter.    Also labourers are the worst kind of people to get a task done.

9420,Supreme Commander: Forged Alliance,"Forged Alliance is the best war RTS ever released. It really shines at huge maps, ditching the minimap to be able to zoom out completely. The maps are huge and it is one of the few strategy games where you get an aircraft carrier and you actually need to use it (if you want).  It is also the RTS which has a nuke and you can actually build anti-nukes. Or cannons shooting their targets from the other side of the map. And yes, this is the game where it actually can take half an hour on the largest maps to get you units from one side to another. Stealth and importan actually becomes quite important too on maps larger than 20x20km as you need multiple radars to know what is happening.  The only problem is that it doesn't support two screens anymore on windows 10 (I tried with eyefinity too, it doesn't work either). You can still split your screen on one widescreen monitor, but it isn't the same thing.  If you ever wondered when playing Starcraft or Command and Conquest what would happen if you could get your hands on the really big units instead of micromanaging a small group of soldiers, get this.",1,0

245170,Skullgirls 2nd Encore,"This game, is a beautiful gem that seems to be underrated! It is even though, a typical fighting styled game, is but of brilliant as the beginning to starting your fighting gaming addiction! With it's addictivly Western x Japanese Jazz Soundtrack, and cute girls that kick each others asses, it's more than worth your money, including the beta to test any changes in advance towards the game.  Yet even though it's fun and a great time-waster, I felt more effort could be put into it. The storylines of each character and how fast-paced each campaign goes is just too fast and rushed, with some of the line-art still a bit dirty and unclean, it gives off a sense of imcompleteness, but sometimes, it's these flaws that create something unqiue, and enjoyable. Having quite improved AI than other fighting games, it also has beautiful revamped animations and backgrounds that are just tantalizing! Being made with love and care of some of the staff now creating Cryamore, I can't wait to see the developement and improvement of this game.  It's worth your dollar, and it's a fun time-waster all for a small price! 8/10, must try for beginner fighting gamers~",1,0

104900,ORION: Prelude,"This game has really mixed reviews everywhere, some people will complain because of bugs, and problems and because in their words the game is ♥♥♥♥, but heres the thing, its 99 cents, its the price of a cheap burger from burger king or something. You dont expect a whole lot for that 99 cents, that being said this game has a lot to it. It has been around for a while as Dino Horde, but they finally got out the Prelude update and it was a free update and now its 99 cents. If you dont wanna play online there are bots now so you can play by yourself. This game has character loadouts so you can change them around, and it has tons of modes. You have human modes like survival and conquest which are fun and now you have deathmatches and stuff like that to play as humans. Then there are modes that let you play as dinos, and guess what its all for 99 cents. This game has been supported for years with free content, updates and support throughout most games dont get that kind of support. Also they have workshop coming to so there is another reason. Plus how many games can you get where you kill dinos? This game is well worth the price, dont listen to all the people ♥♥♥♥♥ing because really its only 99 cents, its not like its expensive, also it has cards too I believe so there's also that. Its fun, its cheap its the best cheap co op game you can get and sink tons of hours into it.",1,0

42910,Magicka,"This is a fantastic game! Although it used to be slow and used to crash often, now it seems to be fixed. I have not experienced any crashes for months and nor have my friends. The best part of the game is the spell casting with lots of ways to mix the elements and cast them in various ways. The physics in the game are good so you can push things of ledges or launch them into the air. The story is intresting and set out well with lots of humorous references which even now I am finding. It is a game best played with friends as you can combine spells, heal and revive one another and friendly fire is always on so you can battle mid game although just after a checkpoint is best and steal your friends equipment. The game can be found difficult as the players don't have much health and many enemies can kill you verry suddenly, This is most seen in single player as you are given just a second life between checkpoints so it can be difficult. The game can also seem easy as you come to learn spells and element combinations that can quickly kill the monsters giving you an easy way to kill bosses in two to three hits in arround 8 seconds and one spell which instantly kills the thing that has taken the most damage would be seen as overpowered exept when you kill yourself with it. To compensate the game throws different chalenges at you such as puzzels or creatures that are healed by some elements e.g. fire but are quickly killed by another e.g. water. But this is what you want from a magic game! It's full of fun fast chaotic gameplay where you have incredible power just may not yet know how to use it (unless you remember the tutorial).",1,0

208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,"Unlike a lot of people that have mixed or negative reactions to this game, I felt it was nearly perfect. I did experience a few glitches, but nothing that ruined my enjoyment. Any lag or performance issues I had I contribute to my lousy computer. I will say the only thing I didn't like about the game was the batmobile. It was fun to an extent, but it's really difficult to control in my opinion. Most of my frustrations came from those types of missions, but they weren't too hard; just slightly annoying.  Overall I feel this game lives up to any expectations I might have had for a sequel to Arkham City. The mere size of the game world is almost inconveivable. It's so much larger than City and there's so much more to do. The side missions (Known as 'Most Wanted') are practically made part of my story. There's so much more in this game period.  The story was a lot longer I felt than the other two games which I appreciated. It was extremely immersive and satisfying.   All-in-all, I really enjoyed this title and it's my personal favorite in the series. 10/10",1,0

It has a fantastic workshop kit and mods that can make your game look amazing or even be the same as Diablo III. It has a generic story wich you don't have to give two tosses about and is NOT great when you play it alone. I recommend you PORT-FORWARD your internet connection and install Tunngle, and you'll be able to play with other people.   Final Sum: 8,9/10, it has some issues but they are easy to forget, like the internet connectivity issue, but it has a easy to use mod kit and mod installation menu, there are some graphical issues here and there but they're not noticable that much, even when not running mods.",1,0

359320,Elite Dangerous,"Wow... This game left me with some serious half chub. There's not been much development and not much that really adds 'fun' To the game since its release. I've had it about 4 months now and there's been few changes besides a sub par politics system that adds 8 reskins of guns with minor changes to their function and 4 ships... whooo. There's still so much they could do and its pretty boring with how repetive it is. There's not much to do. there's like 3 different ways to make money and the pay out is really low for each. This is one of those games that would benefit greatly from micro transactions unfortunately its SIXTY DOLLAR PRICE TAG kind of ruins that opportunity. If this game went free to play with micro transactions I believe it would benefit greatly, unfortunately there'd be the abuse that always follows the addition of such features. The community isn't the best already with a lot of A-holes who are so bored that they turn to picking on the lowest tier players they can find because there's NOTHING TO DO.  HEY GUYS!! Guess what? At the time of writing this edit its august 5th 2015. And they've just announced their dlc. Horizons. Adds a new ship, the ability to explore the planets themselves and land and run about with a rover. And all this for 60 additional dollars. This is killing me. I'm honestly pretty worked up over this decision. Please don't do this Frontier.  January 15th 2016 Wow. A lot has changed since I wrote this review. Many many new ships have been released, horizons is out, and the game has recieved several enhancements and small tweaks. And I'm back into it. I own Horizons and have already put 56 hours into it. Its much more fun now and rewarding. its still rough around the edges but there's more coming I promise you. Frontier has been listening to the community and they've done some work.

377160,Fallout 4,"If you're looking for a linear shooter, this game is worth $60. But if you're looking for a sequel to the other fallout games, at least wait until the winter sale before buying. While it has the feeling of the other fallout games, whenever you look closely you realize that its all very rushed and sometimes even artificial. The dialog is a joke, you have zero influence in your fate except maby choosing faction. but even that is all minimized by a ending that make it all obselete. Skillsystem is so much easier and forgiving. you cant customize you character at all like the older games. Power armors are really cool, have to admit. though I got my first after &lt;4h of gameplay and havn't stepped out since which makes me wonder if there is any reason not to go for that skillpath. Settlements were fun for a couple of hours then it got super boring. And the missions you get from preston to help settlements is such a cheap game element it makes me angry. Why would you add something like WOW's daily quest to a fallout game. It's a story driven game, not a game you farm/raid 1-2 hours.   TL;DR Does not feel like a fallout game, but still fun overall. If $60 is a big chunk of your yearly game budget, I'd say wait until the price drops.",-1,1

276810,Mordheim: City of the Damned,"As someone who has played the actual tabletop game, and still keeps several Warbands on hand (y'know, just in case)... I can very much reccomend this game to anyone that is a fan of the tabletop version. It has it's flaws, and there are bugs, but please keep in mind that this is an Early Access game. They are barely in alpha and aren't even finished making all the warbands. I admit that the limitations of the program now do make it something that would be hard to play often, but as more features are released to people that have already bought it, the game will get much better.   There are currently four warbands to choose from (June 2015) and they are Humans, Skaven, Sisters of Sigmar, and The Cult of the Possessed. The units included are all quite faithful to the source game, and the equipment loadouts are fairly self explainatory to anyone familiar with Mordheim, and easy enough to figure out for new players. Lack of leveling system is disappointing, but that will come in future updates. When the game is more complete it will have a lot more appeal to newer players, or people unfamiliar with the source material.   Gameplay is fairly easy to figure out. Move your character, perform action, etc. Combat animations look decent, the city has some nice detail and the maps look pretty good. Fun overall to play, though definately more fun with other players than against bots. The bots are fine if you just need a quick game, but for the best experience, play with friends. All the best multiplayer games are ones that can end friendships. lol.  TL:DR VERSION: Good game. Currently would rate 6/10, only for limitations of early access version, but well worth investment. Great game, faithful to the source material, and fun to play with friends. 10/10 would buy again.  UPDATE - Full Release Patch 2 - Having played the campaign and had a chance to genuinely enjoy the game a bit now that it has hit full release, I can say that I still do not regret my decision to purchase this game. It remains a very playable, faithful adaptation of the classic tabletop game that still gets played in my house. Looking forward to the addition of more warbands and expanded content in the times to come.   10/10 would descend into the City of the Damned again.",1,0
2400,The Ship,"The Ship is a relatively entertaining game, but is plagued by many flaws.  It came out a while ago - 2006, in fact, and it does show its age, unfortunately. It's 'old-school', but not in a nice way. It all feels just a little bit clunky and laboured while playing it, and that just wouldn't be tolerated if it came out today.  Onto the game itself. I'll address the singleplayer first and foremost - it's pretty short and only lasts about an hour or two. It is intended to prepare you for the multiplayer, the main part of the game, but it's rather ineffective in doing so. You're never placed into a situation you would actually face in the multiplayer - mostly it's a case of go here, talk to this person, kill this guy, rinse and repeat (leaving out the occassional other trivial act). It doesn't help that the singleplayer is very frustrating at points and feels lazily done. To be honest, there's no real point in playing it.  Now, the multiplayer. If you're reading this, I assume you understand the whole concept of the game. The concept does seem extremely entertaining. However, it's not executed as well as you would like. The maps are all too small for 24-32 players like the very few servers remaining are and you often find yourself cramped in rooms, getting blocked in corridors etc. The inclusion of security is poorly done - guards, cameras and witnesses seem to be just about everywhere meaning you rarely ever find a good opportunity to take out your quarry. You look to take out your target, only to realise there's a camera watching and you're arrested for pulling out your weapon. The needs system becomes tedious quickly - I can't be bothered going to the toilet or sleeping when I'm avoiding my hunter and searching for my quarry. You also only have 90 seconds for each round to kill your quarry, which is nowhere nearly enough time. The jail system is another major flaw in the game also - if you kill your quarry, you can deliberately get yourself arrested so as to be protected from the person hunting you. This can then also be undermined by your hunter deliberately putting themselves into jail and seeing if they can get the shank to take you out. There are plenty of other examples of things like this that just make you think 'That could have been done so much better'.  It doesn't help that quite a number of people who play the game run around like headless chickens killing on sight as they are suspicious of anyone around them. Your enjoyment of this game is almost entirely based around other people and how they act - and when they act like they often do, it ruins it.  And I still haven't mentioned the obvious yet - the game is pretty much dead. Servers are mainly filled with bots rather than players. The developers, Outerlight, don't even exist anymore so hopes of changes are nonexistent. However, there's a sequel on Greenlight that looks like it could be very good.   Perhaps I'm not giving the game enough credit - it is relatively fun...for 15 to 20 minute periods. Then the same old flaws appear again and again and you just want to go and play something else. It's a real shame, because if this game had been much, much more polished and it had an active community these days I would have tons of fun with it. I got it for 70p on Bundlestars, and I don't really mind at that price. Let's hope for more in the sequel.",-1,0

You've taken some damage, so you decide to heal (sexual healing sounds mod plays in the background). Your teammate decides to take some viagra (pills mod). In victory you scream out 'stick that up your ♥♥♥!'. You're feelign optimistic, you're close to the saferoom. Suddenly the ground starts to shake and you hear 'I'M THE PARTY POOPER'. Moments later a huge Arnold Schwarzenegger appears, says 'HELLO CUTIE PIE' and starts throwing giant waffles at you (arnold tank mod + waffle tank rock mod). A waffle hits you and you take some damage. Your health is low and you are limping while Arnold is chasing you screaming 'PUT THAT COOKIE DOWN, NOW!'. You quickly set the beast on fire with a Jagermeister (mod) molotov and manage to make it into the saferoom. Sadly your teammate has used up all the healthkits and has ragequitted because you took too long to get into the saferoom.  THIS IS LEFT 4 DEAD 2",1,0

On dozens of occasions, trivially easy jumps failed to land, the 'jump' sound would play, as the character walked straight off the cliff. Sometimes even just standing still I could press jump multiple times and only about 2/3 of them would actually register and jump the character.  Given the platforming nature of the game in general, having the controls be anything less than 100% accurate/responsive is a deal breaker for me.",-1,0

291650,Pillars of Eternity,"I originally gave this games a thumbs up. Turns out to be a big mistake because I hadn't progressed very far yet. I have to completely change my review after experiencing more of the game.   1. This game is SOOO buggy. They keep releasing patches but the bugs never get fixed, or new ones appear. Some bugs are game ending or corrupt save files. Others are just so annoying you want to tear your hair out. The worst of it is the crashing. This game crashes so often it's silly. Usually on load screens, causing you to lose a ton of progress. Sometimes it happens ON THE MAIN MENU. Obsidian really embarassed themselves with their coding job on this one.   2. The rules system is extremely flawed. It's just complicated and nuanced of a magnitude you can't comprehend. In normal D&amp;D, you have very small, simple equations. You attack an orc with an axe, you roll a d20 and add strength plus proficiency. Simple. But in this game there are percentages and 10 million different stats. The main attributes don't even make sense. It just takes everything you expect from an RPG and flips it upside down. They even took Wizards, which are the most powerful class in D&amp;D, and made them ineffective wimps.   3. The gameplay is extremely flawed as well. The main reason is it's 99% combat. You slog through a dungeon, fighting random monsters room-to-room with no story or other activity to break it up. Sure, the dialouge is well written and the plot is rather interesting, but the problem is there is so LITTLE of it. And in between the stuff we really want, there is a bunch of bland, repetitive gameplay. I was expecting this game to be more like Planescape: Torment and stick to Obsidian's roots.   4. Exploration is non-existant. You're confined to small areas in each chapter. You have to progress the main story in order to open up new areas. In addition, maps are VERY small and there aren't many of them.   5. There is EXTREME class imbalance. Certain classes suck and others are rockstars. The way the rule system is set up makes CC, Buffs, and Healing irrelevant. CC and Buffs last less than a minute and can't be cast outside of combat, so you can't pre-buff. Healing doesn't actually restore health, just endurance which replenishes after battles anyway. The only way to play is maximize damage output.   6. Lack of alternatives. The only way to resolve conflict is with fighting, 90% of the time. The game is set up with an awesome skill system. There are 5 skills: athletics, mechanics, lore, survival, and stealth. The problem is that they don't actually use this system at all. It's completely wasted. Not once did I ever see a situation in which one of my skills permitted me an alternative to fighting. In fact, I've never seen the Survival skill used at all, period. It's such a shame that this excellent skill system doesn't impact the game very much and is totally useless.   7. Boring companions. Your buddies you pick up along the way don't have much going on with them. They just drone on and on about one thing. Ok, we get it, this dude is sad that his brother died, move on already. I finally began skipping through their dialouge and didn't regret it later.   I know I shouldn't be upset over this, but I've been eagerly awaiting this game for over a year. I just expected more from Obsidian. I thought this game was the great revival of old school RPG's, but everything about it is just so...bland.",-1,1

298900,Space Hulk: Deathwing,"TL;DR: This game is a perfect example of how much potential the Warhammer 40k franchise has, yet it falls into some of the same pitfalls a lot of gaming titles have that do make use of the W40k ip. It is, however, one of the better specimen out there and has the potential to become a real winner, if the dev team is willing to incorporate additional content and fixes the performance issues.  It shows that the developers really care about the Warhammer universe, but dont really know what a good game in this day and age looks like, at least in terms of gameplay.   Graphics/level design: The graphics are epic if a bit underwhelming at first, because of the heavy use of grain filter and washed out colors. W40k is a dark and gritty universe and Space Hulk does emphasizes that quite heavily. The animations are really well done, and the multiple effects are spot on. You HAVE to see the flames, the heavy flamer spits! Its better than real life!  The level design is flawless. They captured the architectural peculiarities of this Universe perfectly. Absolutely nailed it.  You have the signature gigantic, church like structures mixed with the claustrophobic, tube like corridors that make it clear that you are in an actual space ship.  I think the art and level design teams are the real MVPs here.  Which brings me to the gameplay and technical side of the game and there the game loses a lot of good will.  Performance: The game is quite hit and miss in terms of performance and I really hope they are working overtime to remedy the worst offenders here. It is not quite as bad as Batman: Arkham Knight, at least for me, but its not in a good state. Fatal crashes and heavy stuttering in more action packed situations are a common occurance. Multiplayer is a mess. The Beta fared much better. Constant disconnects due to crashing of the game for hosts and other issues plague multiplayer.  Gameplay:  I have to be blunt here: It is quite uninspired, yes, some would even argue, it is boring. You are walking through the ship, fighting waves after waves of Xenos, rinse and repeat, which wouldn't be all that bad, but there is so precious little backstory, progression, collectibles or side quests, it leaves you wanting. Every level plays out the exact same: Go from A to B kill hordes of monsters, go to the next checkpoint, kill hordes of monsters. Meanwhile you learn very little about your surroundings, the universe, your unit, etc.  There are collectibles in the form of relics, but they appear to serve no purpose whatsoever, aside form letting you view them in a seperate window. But you cannot equip them and they come with no fluff whatsoever. A big missed Opportunity here.  You have a very basic RPG-Style talent tree with three branches and the most interactive and fun one is the Psyker one, which lets you learn new abilities. The other two are helpful but as boring as they can possibly get.  There is no character customization. Neither in single player nor multiplayer.  Speaking of Multiplayer: A game like this would be perfect for coop one might think. But actually, the multiplayer is the same levels and objectives as in single player, but even more toned down. you cannot even collect relics or have additional stuff to do, you just solve one objective after the other, rinse and repeat. Between each mission, your sparse skill tree gets competely reset, which results in a MOBA like tabula rasa experience. Character progression and attachment are non existent.  Again a huge opportunity missed there.  This game oozes charme and potential. It has it in spades. That makes it all the more disappointing that the gameplay is so emotionless and void af any highs.  Devs, I really hope that you realize how good of a start this game is and that you take the suggestions of the community at heart!",1,0

268500,XCOM 2,"Edit: 23.11.2016: The game still runs like in the last edit 9 months ago, which is, not great. If you have a GTX 770 or equivalent, DO NOT GET THIS GAME.  Edit 15.2.2016: Nvidia just released the 361.91 game ready driver which includes an SLI profile for XCOM 2. This however has a negative impact on the performance and also disables the cover icons which are incremental to the game and not something you can overlook. I had better experience trying out a custom SLI profile with Nvidia Inspector but it also caused the same bug so this isn't quite optimal. Oh dear.  The most anticipated game i've had all year, and i gotta give it a negative review. Great.  So, XCOM 2. The core game is great, awesome in fact. But the problem is once again the bane of all PC gaming for the last few years, performance. Now, devs really need to start understanding something. And that's the fact that you CANNOT release a game in an unfinished, buggy, badly performing POS state like this. You just can't, it's not under ANY circumstance acceptable that a game like this doesn't run on my $1500 rig with even medium settings and 60fps stable.  Now, it's a turn based game. Yeah, i can kinda understand when some people use that as an argument to counter the fact it runs like total bottocks. But that's not all, you heard right the performance isn't even 50% of the real issue. The real creep that ruins this game is the massive, swarming amount of bugs underneath it. In every match i've played in the game so far i've experienced some of the following;   1.) Visual bugs. 2.) AI Bugs. 3.) Animations stall the game to a crawl type of bugs. 4.) Aliens completely bugging out and flat out ignoring the rules of the game type of bugs. 5.) Bugs like the AI getting an extra turn all the sudden because of reasons type of bugs. 6.) Game breaking, game ending, save corrupting and really infuriating bugs.  So yeah, basically DO NOT buy this game until they've fixed it. These are not issues that only me or a few select people are having, these are happening to the majority of the players. And those refusing to accept this fact are either living in denial because their favorite game isn't what they hoped it would be or are just flat out trolling.  Peace out.",-1,0

These sort of historically time-framed games that the Total War franchise has created has been nothing short of a pleasure.  For those who are new to strategy games; this is definitely the one you will want; to ease you into that 'Emperor's' mindframe. The prologue campaign illustrates how to work the game to its best effect. However, the way to make whatever faction a person may choose to be the most effective is all dependent on the decision one makes. This is honestly what makes this game fun for me. The ability to choose and follow whatever path that will lead to victory.  The only negative mark that I have for this game is that there are still problems with the effectiveness or 'polish' of the AI. AI will still make some dumb decisions in a battle, and ultimately leads to making the game a bit easier on the player.",1,0
250320,The Wolf Among Us,"Saves often fail to carry across which prompts me to restart chapters until the save will at last work. This has happened on multiple occasions and as of the most recent one, i have to go back from episode 4 to episode 1. I have heard that failed game save transfers is a common thing among telltale games (eg. The Walking Dead). For an episodic game, it would be beyond sensible to ensure that the decisions made in previous chapters carry across otherwise i see very little point in the entire game revolving around those decisions and the consequences they bring in following chapters.   The game is far more exciting, from my point of view, than The Walking Dead. It has a unique story and the entire 'detective' type of game play i got to take part in was simply fun. Albeit i would have liked more content, as hard as that is to say (I won't go into detail, for i cannot. I blatantly feel like something was missing, perhaps it was the character, maybe i just want to delve deeper into them).   I do enjoy the game, i really do, but if a game based on decisions forgets those decisions as you progress - i'm going to struggle to approve of the game in itself. Sure, the glitch or whatever it may be does not occur all the time, but the problem en lies in the fact that it /does/ occur.  Based solely on the emptiness i felt and the absolutely atrocious, though rare 'glitch', i do not recommend spending your money on this game 'less there is a sale on which significantly reduces the price.

Characters feel much more alive, breathing, swaying hair, talking, and blinking look more smooth and natural than I've ever seen. All 3 characters are very likable in each of their routes. The only downside is how short it is! Just when I was starting to get really invested in each of the characters, things were suddenly rushed and the stories ended.   But that's only a small factor to consider, the positive of the game heavily outweighs the small negative. Each of the 3 stories are fairly nice.

245150,The Novelist,"Reviewed for my website:  http://www.cublikefoot.com/review/the-novelist-game-review/   The Novelist is a completely story-driven adventure in which the player takes on the role of a supernatural being that decides a family's fate. I'd even go as far as branding it as an interactive story. It was an excellent narrative experience nonetheless.  The gameplay is offered in two different flavors: Stealth and Story. In the stealth mode of the game, you're challenged to not be spotted by the family throughout the entirety of your playthrough. This is easily done, but there were a few scenarios where I made a few of the characters 'suspicious'. Upon the characters catching your appearance again, they become 'scared'. Once they're scared, you're unable to choose a compromise for that chapter (more on that later). The story mode of the game is for those that just want to experience the story, without the element of stealth playing a role.  Essentially, you're tasked with finding each character's own desires through their thoughts and objects they've interacted with (drawings, writings, etc.). The majority of the story is told through these writings and drawings. The game is laid out in a series of chapters, covering the events during a summer in the character's lives. The player is the one that decides what will happen during this summer. At the end of each chapter, you make a decision based on the three family member's thoughts. You cannot please all three characters, but you can select up to two outcomes, called a 'compromise'.  A compromise can only be accomplished if you have learned what each character wants, well, the characters you want to choose an outcome for. Upon selecting an initial outcome, you can then select another one. This is a nice addition and doesn't make me feel so bad about the terrible choices I made throughout my playthrough. The fact that not everyone can be happy is hard to accept and The Novelist truly shows this. Makes me wonder if it is really that difficult to manage a family. It was painful for me to always put down Tommy's outcomes, but they were simply not as important as the other outcomes offered, at least, to me. The Novelist employs a very anguishing story. It's simply... depressing, the way events played out. It is very difficult to get a great outcome for the family, without at least one member being very dissatisfied (and in my case, two). The game does show how difficult a family can be, but I never realized it could be this degrading, although, the family in this game is placed under a lot more stress than what you'd expect from an average family on summer vacation.  The game's graphics were great. The style reminded me of Borderlands, but the name of this style escapes me. I believe it's called 'cel-shaded'. The music in the game was also excellent, although I am a sucker for game music, heh. The voice acting was top-notch, very well done. I enjoyed having the writings read to me, but a few of them (the writings from characters that you're never introduced to) had no voice to them, which was somewhat disappointing, but understandable.  The Novelist was an excellent story, easy to immerse yourself in. I highly recommend it for anyone that plays games for the story, not so much for the gameplay. It truly is a fascinating game, if played by the appropriate player.          YouTube™ Video:  The Novelist (Video Review)&nbsp;",1,0

377160,Fallout 4,"It is a shame that Fallout 4 turned from RPG with FPS elements (3 and New Vegas) into FPS with light RPG elements.  tl:dr version:  Good game, bad RPG. Bethesda's writing is inferior to Obsidian's.  As this is a PC game it means I'll have to nitpick about the port. At this point it's clear that Bethesda doesn't care about PC side. The game is designed to run at 60 fps and is locked to it via v-sync and we know what that does to mouse controls. Things like FoV, V-sync and depth of field are buried in multiple .ini files and you have to set them to read only or the game reverts them back to default values. As V-sync is enabled by default the game has terrible mouse acceleration problems and disabling V-sync also introduced screen tearing, forcing me to use third party software to lock my FPS. Screen tearing was solved by locking the frame rate bit higher than 60. The performance isn't anything spectacular either with frame drops when entering anywhere with more than few buildings. I was forced to drop it down to medium settings to avoid biggest drops which is something I shouldn't have to do with my hardware. (i5-3570k, 16GB RAM, GTX 980 and installed on WD Black 7200rpm HDD) The loading times were dreadfully long at times. At the worst I could've gone and made a cup of tea and it would still be loading. Fortunately I've experienced only few crashes. There's been few bugs such as entering power armor or terminal and character gets stuck forcing you to reload your previous save. I encountered one game breaking bug that made me restart the game but luckily it happened only few hours into the game. The bug gave me constant radiation damage no matter where I was.  There's not much story to speak of. Your characters are locked with specific background stories and they're fully voice acted which I feel detracts from the RPG element. At the start of the game you're hurried up into a vault, see the bomb go boom and then you're turned into a meat popsicle. Later you wake up, your significant other is killed, your baby kidnapped and then it's for a rescue. Not much really happens between leaving the vault and finding your son, you're mostly doing fetch quests for others until you get to him. Biggest things that happen are when you finally decide to join up with a faction.   I said that this is more like FPS than RPG so what do I mean with it? No karma, skills have been removed, only perks remain and traits do not exist anymore. I get what they were going for with removing the skills. They wanted to avoid the waste of levels between skill checks (76-99 in lockpicking were totally wasted) but then they gated them behind level checks so it doesn't really change it. No level cap throws any consideration for builds out of the window as every character will end up being the same at some point, you can even use your level up points for your SPECIAL stats which makes builds even more redundant because you don't have to make any sacrifices. Conversations consist of yes, no, question and sarcastic responses and what you are going to say are shown to you really vaguely instead of full responses. Speech checks are dice rolls, meaning you can just save scum until you pass it. Intelligence 1 characters are treated the same as int 10 so no more silly dialogue.  Companions are more like walking witty comment machines than people following you. You can't initiate conversations with them and they don't have their own agendas. As an example: Boone from New Vegas will warn you that he will engage any Legion members on sight no matter what and oh boy will he do it, I just helped him by giving him antimateria rifle. In F4llout the Brotherhood of Steel wants to exterminate everything that isn't human but don't do ♥♥♥♥ about it when you bring a synth, super mutant or a ghoul into their place, nor will your companions care where you bring them. The worst you'll get is a mean comment from someone. You're better off without any of them, they can't shoot straight and get in your way all the time.   The well hyped customization also falls flat on its face. The base weapon variety is lacking so you don't have much of a choice in what you're going to use. And no, modding 10mm pistol to fire full auto doesn't make it an SMG or putting different colored grip doesn't turn it into different weapon. The hardest thing about modifying your gear is finding the materials to do it, not deciding what you want to put on as +damage is the only way to go.  The settlement building was a good idea but as usual Bethesda leaves it half way done and expects modders to make it better. Why can't I decide where I can build my settlement? I'm restricted to wherever they've put the workbenches and work with it. You can't change the terrain or sink objects into it so your protective walls will be floating in the air and being ugly. Halo 3 back in 2007 got this right. The variety of items you can place is limited and by limited I mean you can't build half the items you see in the world. Then you have the settlers who occupy your settlements. You can assign them to do different tasks but you don't see who is doing what and some don't do whatever free jobs are around without you telling them and even doing so they can ignore it. Then they have the nerve to tell you 'thanks to our work this is starting to look like home and you're welcome here too' ♥♥♥♥♥, I build this for you and now you act like you own the place.    Next part gets into spoiler territory about factions so feel free to skip it.   There are four factions you can join which are the Minutemen, Brotherhood of Steel, Railroad and   the Institute.  I don't really know what the Minutemen want to do other than trying to help people against the dangers of wasteland. After finding out that a big group of them turned into bandits after the group started fighting each other I didn't want to help these people into position of power.  Railroad wants to free synths from Institute's control but they lack any kind of longterm goal to consider helping them. They're too busy liberating vending machines to think about it. If you decide to help them they blow up half of Commonwealth. I'm not joking, they're going to overload the Institute's nuclear reactor.  Brotherhood of Steel are still being jerks towards anybody and taking what they want at gunpoint. They're really no better than bandits, they are just better armed and more fanatic. Their goal is to clear Commonwealth of all scum, meaning super mutants, synths, ghouls and other nasties. They also blow up the Institute's reactor.  The Institute is the boogeyman of the Commonwealth, in short they're mad scientists with no real goal in mind. They produce synths (synthetic humans), kidnap people and replace them with synth copies. Why? I don't know. They also like to tell you that synths are mere tools but why do they insist on making them indistinguishable from humans? They tell you that replacing all humans with synths is the best hope for mankind. They are also responsible for super mutants being present in the Commonwealth. They experimented with the FEV virus and instead of disposing their failed experiments they let them go to the surface. Initially I was ready to join up with BoS even though they're ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s but they had clear motivations about what they want. I changed my mind about betraying them after hearing that I'll be the next leader of the Institute and thought that I could change all the insane things they're doing. Unfortunately as a leader all you get is one meaningless choice and repeating quests.     Spoilers about factions end here   Finally the ending, it's weak. All you get is two different slides with commentary that barely differentiate from each other. They're literally called 'Male A, B. Female A, B' You don't get anything about what happens with your companions, your settlements, the people you met or the cities you visited. Nothing.",-1,1

You'll be torn apart after spending weeks working with one character only to have him/her die a dramatic cinematic death in the blazing fires of the battlefield. XCOM has a great soundtrack, good visuals, and will run you about 26 hours if you play all the way through. The game uses turn based mechanics similar to that of the earlier Fallout, and Wasteland games. Its only pitfall is that the mission scenarios can be extremely repetitive and require alot of time to finish. The game is also very indirect about what the current objective is while you're playing. I would recommend this title to anyone who likes to be immersed in an interesting game. But I don't recommend it if you're planning on playing another game at the same time as it will take lots of time and dedication to get through.",1,0

I call it 2,5D cause it's a mix between 2D and 3D. ;D  It's like Limbo, Prince of Persia(original), The Walking Dead, I am alive and/or movies like I am Legend and more.  Story is nice but a bit similar to 'I am alive'. Man is alone and searches for his wife and daughter. The ending was great and sad together like most horror games.  The puzzles in this game are not that hard if you are familiar to games like this. The side scrolling gives you much feeling of old games from the 80'. You have a health and a stamina bar. Both can go down ofc. XD  For ~10€ totally worth to buy. Got my 100% playtrough in 6 and a 1/2 hours. Found most secrets while playing and exploring, you can go back in every single scene to collect missed stuff. And you can unlock 3 handheld minigames which is just awesome.

I knew when I was going to buy it that It wouldn't be worth it yet the coverage hyped it up to be a great game. The driving is alright where collisions are totally unrealistic. Combat is alright where the most fun part of the game is just getting a chase and using your powers to dispatch enemies or doing the crime missions.  The main positive I guess is the story which I'm finding pretty interesting and so is the lore of the game and I'm told the ending is amazing.,-1,0
297350,The Old City: Leviathan,"I've never played a proper walking simulator before playing this one and I think the kind of game it is is actually very interesting and could be a great medium for storytelling and philosophical thought provoking and such. This game however just doesn't quite acheive it. It seems to be loosely based on the biblical story of Jonah and the Whale which is a fantastic story with wonderful imagery; great stuff to base this kind of game on. My problem however, is that there is basically no plot, what the protagonist says is usually pretty poetic babble with a loose basis in actually very interesting philosophy.   The 'plot' is more like an idea for a post apocalyptic world order based on three opposing philosophical doctrines: extreme religion (there is no truth but God), extreme atheism (there is no God but truth) and extreme agnosticism (there is no truth, period). These all have their justifications which you explore by reading the various posters and book pages scattered everywhere.   My biggest problem however, was the actual gameplay; you have no way of knowing whether you will progress to the next level if you open a door. That means that you can't be sure you've explored everywhere before moving on which means its almost inevitable that you do not have the complete story (not that there's much coherant progression anyway). What this means is that I was perpetually in the dark about what was really going on, who I was, where I was gong or why and where everyone else was.   The most impressive scene was the last part where you enter the whale but instead of reaching some new place that might give you some indication of what it was all for, you end up where you started. Perhaps its all an elaborate metaphor for the spiritual journey of Jonah but really, I'd have preferred more guidance for that.  You can collect secret stashes of documents written by another character you never see 'Solomon', but when I saw how long they were I did not want to read them. So the only vaguely interesting part of the actual gameplay (I love finding secrets and collectibles) became completely undesirable.  Since the pictures looked so pretty (and the game is pretty; the light is beautifully rendered and some of the landscapes are stunningly surreal) I was quite dissappointed in the lack of variety in the environments (but maybe I'm demanding a bit too much from the developers here).   Generally, I'm sad to say, I was disappointed in the game.",-1,0

292660,Princess Isabella,"Cute Disney-princess-like puzzle/hidden object game. Probably best suited for kids as the puzzles are easy and the fairy helper easily hints/solves the puzzles if you're stuck.  The player controls princess Isabella after she came home to her castle, which was cursed in her absence. Move from room to room and remove the curse in each room. There is some backtracking, but as the map lets you jump to rooms, this is not a problem. Your fairy companion gains abilities as you progress through the castle.  I encountered one bug only and it was getting 2 of the same item as I clicked too fast to pick it up. It did not change the game in any way other than having that extra item in my inventory.   There is some seriously flawed logic in this game; of course the normal magic/fairy, but also 'lighting this fire will remove the curse from the room because warm = not evil' while in another room'putting out this fire will remove the curse from the room'. wut. There is no punishment for missclicking in the hidden object games other than not being able to click for a few seconds. The fairy will help you complete if you're stuck.   Decent graphics, music and voice acting. Very Disney-like in sound effects. I had to turn down the music and sounds as there are too loud compared to the voices on default. A lot of small cutscenes, but all are skippable by mouse-clicking.   Recommended for younger players, really cute game.",1,0

341390,Vulture for NetHack,"Nethack is an incredibly difficult tile-based roguelike. The game is always different every time you play, and being a roguelike, death is permanent. Each playthrough tells a tale of how horribly your player character dies, (or lives, if you escape the dungeon, or actually BEAT THE GAME) and because of the random nature of the game, you are going to die in many different sadistic and stupid ways. For instance, see that pretty amulet lying on the floor?    Out of curiousity, you pick it up and wear it. The amulet strangles you to death and you die.   Overall, I find this game both very fun and challenging. There are free versions of nethack available in the form of ascii and tiled, top-down versions, so if you're not sure about it, I recommend getting either one of those versions first before playing.

11450,Overlord,"Overlord is an action/strategy hybrid that has you ordering masses of weak minions about as an equally weak evil (or just evilish, depending on how you respond to the binary 'choice' system) Overlord (heh, eh). Without your minions you suck, and small masses or individual minions suck worse. However, together you and the little red/green/brown/blue imps can form an unbeatable team of chaos...so long as you can master the controls and don't have too many technical issues.  The worst thing about this game are the controls. Overlord is an experience that demands a level of precision and skill that my controller and I are incapable of. Initially pleasant and open levels give way to tight-corners and enemy puzzles that require quick and accurate adaptation on the fly, yet the camera is incapable of keeping up. On the controller, the stick you would normally use for controlling the camera is used to guide your brain-challenged minions around the environment. Using the mouse allows for easier camera control, but I couldn't 'send' my minions at anything when I tried it. The camera follows either you or a minion you're controlling, and if you're trying to move and control minions at the same time in tight spaces it has a tendency to freak out or try abrupt and nauseating angles. The camera has two settings, behind the back and top-down, but neither is useful.  A terrible camera isn't a killer, but poor minion controls are. Later levels have you coordinating your four minion types by role: Greens back stab, Blues heal, Reds throw fireballs, and Browns soak up damage. You can pin and recall groups of minions to/from spots, but while the pin function is individual to your selected units the recall function will recall ALL units, which can easily and quickly ruin any plans you might have. The challenge of the game exacerbates this, as all minions but the Browns die extremely easily. The Blues are almost useless if not for their healing, and many enemies in later levels are entirely immune to the Reds. Additionally, the only way you may replenish your army is by killing certain enemies, while every new encounter seems designed to go through a sizable number of minions to just get it done (figuring everything out is usually the easy part). So, by the second to last boss fight I managed to run entirely out of the only minion who could do reliable damage to ANYTHING in the level, and the only way to earn my minions back would be through extensive, boring, stupid, ugly grinding.  Finally, the game lags on my computer. Mostly it seems related to if/when I run ANYTHING in the background, but other times it slows down for no apparent reason. It's extremely odd, and makes no sense given the number of things I can otherwise run just fine.  I want to recommend Overlord for the opportunity to play the leader of a mob of idiots, but the controls just ruin everything.",-1,1

There are alot off extras in this if you compare it to the original version back on the playstation.  I don't want to give much away so im not but dogs &amp; zombies jumping out at you when your playing the game alone in the dark is a must!  True classic &amp; still one of the best! Buy it now!!",1,0
212480,Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed Collection,Since you can't get Mario Kart for PC this is probably the only good Kart racer on PC imho. Feels a lot more fluid than Mario Kart and is faster paced. Characters line-up is strong but the vehicles are a let down.,1,0

Im not sure how the server system works but so far so good. There are occasional lag spikes but the game is well worth it. I would pay for this game and already have got some in game packs, My Rating as of 9/1/15 is 8.5/10. Once they fix the lag and let us choose a realm i would be happy, also maybe be able to have more people in one chunk of land. THANKS DEVS AND KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK",1,0

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"Forget everything you know about games. OK? Good. Now welcome to Dark Souls. Probably one of the most unforgiving games out there, it still is a load of fun and you always get that good feeling of accomplishment after passing a tough area, deafeaing a boss, ect. This game does NOT hold you hand. In fact, It takes you hand, rips it off and then proceeds to beat you to death with it. Around every corner there are traps, deadly enemies and everything else that can kill you in a single hit. You can only win this game by dying over and over and over and over and over... Trial and error is the best way to put it. With so many different ways to play, weapons to use and upgrade and differnet routes to take, the game has a high replay value. If you're up for a challenging game to still have a lot of fun playing, Dark Souls gets my reccomendation. Praise the sun!",1,0
99700,NightSky,"Some good physics puzzles, but I didn't particularly care for the way the abilities at your disposal (i.e. fast, heavy, reverse gravity, etc) were capriciously granted and revoked at the developer's whim at each new screen. I started to get annoyed with it once the game started to make me replay the previous 3 screens just for failing the puzzle on one screen (I already solved those!). Also kinda annoyed by the mechanic where you have to forward spin off a ramp into the ceiling, then change to a backspin mid-air to hit the ceiling and reverse direction, etc. Just found it a little too irritating to pull off.  But if you enjoy physics puzzles, then take this review with a grain of salt, dear readers. I am not a fan of physics games at all and almost always find them annoying, so this is probably more a matter of me having no taste for this type of game than it is a problem with the game itself.",-1,0

As a whole the game is rather simple, I doubt I will replay it but playing it all the way through even once was very satisfying. For the price, I would say it's worth it, and if you have a crappy computer like me you will be happy to find that this game is not too resource intensive. I would suggest giving this game a try to anyone who likes survival games, sandbox games, or games that make you feel something genuine.",1,0
209160,Call of Duty: Ghosts,"this game is not worth the money, campaign lasts 5-6 hours then you are stuck playing multiplayer. On normal multiplayer there are 1000 players split through playlists so u actually find (and start with all those ♥♥♥♥♥♥ intermissions) a game in 3 minutes. BTW you will get ♥♥♥♥♥♥ off because of LAG, CAMPERS and some weird AIMBOTS that not only auto aim, they are killing you through many walls. anyway you forget it cuz it has 2 more multiplayer modes (yay). yeah, you wish. on squads there are barely 100 players and at least 20 game modes with 5 players on some and none on the rest. extinction is a nice game mode (has nothing to do with zombies) but they pulled off the same ♥♥♥♥ with the many game modes. if u anyway find game, some stupid noobs will come and ruin the game by doing the exact opposite of the chalenges. also i will have to say something more about the lag: it needs 0,5 MB (mega byte) or 4 Mbit (mega bit) connection; that's what requirements say. not true, you need 2 MB(mega byte) or 16 Mbit(mega bit) to play without lag. also, graphics are worse than 8 or 10 year old games and FPS drops a lot.

When I look for a multiplayer game, there usually isn't anybody. The one time I found another player, I must have looked too much like a noob and he booted me before launching the game.  Really not fun like the original was.  I played it some more, since writing the above. I managed to get into some more multiplayer games, but I just get kicked.

10090,Call of Duty: World at War,"After 45+ hours of playing I think its time to give it a review. NOTE: I didn't try Multiplayer or Campaign. So this review is entirely based on zombies. Pros- You get All of the DLC's with the game.  The custom zombies community is amazing and there is always fresh content to try, some maps even equal Treyarch zombie maps or might even be better than some Treyarch maps. Mods are super easy to download and install. Your PC can be horrible and you can still run this game. Decently Optimised. Cons- Servers are still there if your prepared to wait, however sometimes it feels like your the only one looking to play a game of zombies.  Thats about it, I highly recommend this game for zombies alone. I would even recommend at 40 euro since the custom zombies community is constantly pumping out new content and I have 45 hours into this game and I only played like 4 maps, even though I downloaded more. Hundreds of hours worth of zombie maps online. Well worth the purchase.",1,0

It more or less pays homage to the old series very lightly, as the big daddy types are in the game but they're not so pronounced, as are the lack of morality choices. I'll have to play though it again and see if what moral choices you make change anything, but I feel it shouldn't and the game should focus more on the concept of no free will.",1,0

20500,Red Faction: Guerrilla Steam Edition,"It's very enjoyable game, especially the Single Player campaign. You don't see destructable structures in many games and here you have one where you can really go wild. It also opens up many strategies and possiblities in this game. And it really adds the feeling of 'liberty' when you can just smash through any wall in your way. The story isn't really that much out of the ordinary even though there was moments where I actually felt some sense of epic. They could have added some explanation for the main characters inhumane strength, tho (like cybernetic body enhancement which would have fitted the game quite well). The comat system could be a little better, after all it's quite annoying to do several headshots on enemies in general. You run out of ammo a little bit too quickly and the ground not being destructable makes some locations just plain annoying. One thing, I want to add, is, that the 'artstyle' of the game are, in my opinion, really cool. Especially the enemies' vehicles' bulky looks are just, yea, cool-looking and I always enjoyed driving them. I can definitely recommend this game for the price it costs and if there will be ever a follow-up I'll probably buy it. I haven't mentioned the Multiplayer since it's just not really worth mentioning. It's not bad and some game modes are quite fun but the last time I played, it was more or less dead.

91700,E.Y.E: Divine Cybermancy,"An exceptional, standout action-shooter rpg, with a few quirks, brilliant art style, and a unique vision.  The gameplay is punchy, colorful, and varied enough that I find myself continuing to come back.  This game is heavy with customization which will create a bump in the road for some, but once you get over this initial (5 minute) hump of the menu system, you'll have yourself onto a rocking ride set in an intriguing universe.  Combat seamlessly mixes GUNS, SWORDS, and PSYCHIC POWERS, while fusing with machinery. Its a lethal combination that can be crafted to your personal taste. Hacking, Machine control, rambo-style play, stealth, super-human abilities... its all here. Whatever you want.  This game sets itself apart in art style, excellent combat, nonlinear branching story (with meaningful plot points the player can influence), and a setting/mood that REALLY takes you somewhere else.  If you take time to pick up the snippets of story and explore a bit you'll enjoy it more.  The ambient-orchestral soundtrack is peerless for games in this category.  The customization is deep and allows you to truly craft any character style you can think of.  The fact that this was an indie game made for less than $1m is stunning. The production values for a game of this type are rather high.  While lacking in extensive voice overs, I found that the quirky dialogue and text based story actually added literary charm from the game and did not detract from the main idea.  Excellent gunplay, co-op, deathmatch, cool characters, and meaningful branching story choices will create a sense of intrigue, deep moods, and powerful action.  The only thing that would stop you from enjoying this is You are tossed into the game and expected to figure it out. Please take the time (5 minutes tops) to do so. You won't regret it.  For ten bucks (I got it for $5 steam sale), its a steal. It's been almost 3 years since this game came out and I'm still playing it.  Somehow it just hits on all of the right notes. Play it. And if you do, message me for a multiplayer game.  Good job. I hope to see more updates from this studio.",1,0

Not to mention the numerous times my games didn't load, or for some reason decided to just stop. Literally everyone except for myself stopped and became unkillable. Not only was this counted as a loss, but I had to force quit the game. I had a bad feeling about this game once it crashed when I changed my settings. I once again cannot stress how badly I wanted to like this game. It's a fast paced, small map, shooter. It's been done a MILLION times, but the setting was quite interesting. For now, I'd say play blacklight retribution. It doesn't have your Anime ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t, but at least the game itself is great. Wait until this one is fixed. Luckily, it's free to play and in alpha. Hopefully that means improvement. Sadly, it's nexon. Who knows if these problems will be fixed.",-1,1

359320,Elite Dangerous,I wouldn't suggest or recommend this game for those who want a single player game its not a bad game but what the companys owner did was pretty screwed up to remove a SP mode all cause they are scared of potential Cheaters they can easily fix that by leaving the Online feature closely monitored but instead they chosen the way of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ off customers who have left the game cause they made a horrid call.  I agree that was a stupid move yeah i knew this game was a online only but seriously they could of left a choice with SP and MP mode.  the worse ♥♥♥♥ move they made and you can only get a partial refund which is pretty much another way of them gaining a worse reputation congratulations on being one of the most unliked gaming companies out there. i did request a steam refund but they refused it even though it was not a full week. i shall not ever purchase anything from a gaming company ran by a untelligent idiot who thinks more money than its customers f you little boy and your stupid little ego..,-1,0

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"This game is very good. Not for everyone though, if you come into Dark Souls thinking that it's going to be the hardest game ever, don't. It's not. What it is, though, is challenging, while being completely fair (Well, most of the time.There is atleast one instance I thnk that of being not so well designed). On your first play through if do not look up guides and just try to expierence the game for what it is, it will be a great experience.   Dark Souls is jammed packed full of atmosphere, mood, and lore, although only some of the story is given to you at the start. To learn more about Dark Souls, you have to experience Dark Souls, pay attention to what the characters do, and read the descriptions on the items. The characters will interact with you, and each other, though that wont be so obvious.  Be Warned, too. The game is a direct and poorly done port. There are controls for Keyboard, with out mods. Though they are extremely hard to figure out on your own. I would recommend playing with a game pad. I personally use an Xbox 360 pad and it works adequately. For more fixes, I would suggest downloading DSFix and DSCFix, for general fixes and connectivity fixes respectively.   Another Warning, although not quite as large as some would perhaps lead you to believe, the pvp scene of the game does have a small hacking problem.  In Conclusion: You should think about buying this game if you like challenging games that require you to learn, games with a very dark mood, and if you like having to play games to experience the story rather than just being told straight fowardly what the game is about.",1,0

369200,,"I've personally really enjoyed this game. Streamed it a bit, made a couple youtube videos of it and it's just a blast to play even without a party or friends playing with you. There are a few quirks that are still in the game and need to be worked out, but it's mainly menu stuff. Plus it's Nexon so of course it's going to take a while to unlock everything and grind.  The one thing that I really don't like is how much time you have between matches. I understand you want players to be in and out of matches as quick as possible, but it's very hard try to change up equipment on your guns or your characters with the given time you have. 25 seconds is not long enough at all for this. You're barely able to change one things before the game pulls you out of whatever you're doing because the next game is going to start in 10 seconds. It would be a lot easier if there wasn't sub-menu upon sub-menu to comb through.  Do I recommend this game? Absolutely. It's fun, it's quite addicting, and even when your fingers are hurting you still want to get in that one last game before you're done.",1,0

Some of the art looks great, some of it looks poor and rudimentary with the video settings maxed. The map is cluttered and finding your units is difficult. Even the lore seems half baked, delivered through prefaces to a mandatory quest line. (Inane quests like bring two units to level 2.) I'm not going to bother to play enough to really get a feel for the AI, but many of the negative reviews cite the AI as being a major problem.   Major Cons: Slow, less than smooth gameplay with illusions of rich lore, complex strategy, and tactical battle.

I was curious as to how a story can be told without text, and Freebird Games has demonstrated that A Bird Story couldn't be told any other way; a heartwarming tale about a boy and a bird, which sets the canvas in place for the (eagerly awaited) game that follows To the Moon.   The amount of user-input required throughout A Bird Story hits the fine line between immersion and control; it felt like I was in a movie and experiencing the story rather than watching the story unfold before my eyes.   In conclusion, I'd definitely recommend A Bird Story if you enjoyed To the Moon, or if you want a short story that leaves a warm and fuzzy feeling in your heart.",1,0

200900,Cave Story+,"The game is pretty fun, I never really played much of the original so I can't say much about the remade graphics and remastered music. The game its self is really cool, with great sound, music, etc. The game is all around pretty great. However, there is one majoooor problem that loses points in my book. The devs were too lazy to update the aspect ratio. That's right, for ANYONE using a widescreen monitor, you're going to have those nasty black pillars of doom. We're in 2011 at this point, how many games don't support widescreen? There's no way to stretch the game as far as I know either. I majorly wanted this since the original had this problem as well. You can get used to the black bars after a while, but this is still a huge lazy problem. 8/10 regardless. Easily a 9/10 if the game was properly updated for widescreen. If the black bars thing bothers you a lot, stay away. But this is a fantastic litle game, easy for anyone to run and it's very, very fun.",1,0

The way it controls, with the dialog, the items, the choices, you really feel like you're there at a desk, sighing before starting work and sighing at peoples pointless chatter and sigh at peoples obviously wrong documents, 'I'm just doing my job here, you're wasting my time with that out of date passport'. In that way, it's a very realistic job simulator.  And later, you start to feel the importance of your work. It is not just stamping documents, It is determining peoples future, the safety of those you work with and your country, secret agencies.. And your family. Which, if you suck, will die much like Oregon Trail. It has a very organic measure of how well you're doing and how.  And all of that, mixed with the plotlines, the worry behind every decision, constantly balacing on a knifes' edge, the moments you need to pull the trigger, the sense of dissappointment if you miss a crucial detail and it ends up costing peoples lifes..

220200,Kerbal Space Program,"Extremely fun and addictive game, especially for the fans of space and space exploration.  Game consists of 3 modes: Campaign, Science and Sandbox  Sandbox is quite straightforward (although not exactly simple): construct your rocket / plane and travel the Kerbin solar system. There are a lot of parts that you can construct your rocket with, and since the game uses Newtonian physics there is lot of fun to be had with this mode only.  Game features science mode where the goal is to gain science throught research and exploration, which in turn unlocks technologies (parts) that allow you to go further and do more stuff (and gain more science).  Career mode is a recent addition to the game, bringing depth and complexity. It requires you to manage science, funds as well as reputation in a race towards the stars (or at least the solar system)  When i first saw the game on steam, it looked honestly so, so. I was gravely mistaken. The game itself is awesome, and gives more gameplay value than most titles I have purchased recently (just the vanilla version).  What makes this game truly addictive and unforgettable, is a ton of mods which in my opinion raise the bar and the overall feel of this game to unforgettable.  If you are in doubts, try the demo. From my perspective, best 25€ spent on a game in last 2 years.  Do not be fooled by my steam on record hours in game. I stopped playing game on steam for more than a year now due to overwhelming amount of mods i use.

The only dissappointing thing about this game from a Warhammer point of view is the absence of certain units from the game such as the Chaos Land Raider.

251830,Stick It To The Man!,"One of the better indie games out there. An interesting title that does things differently.  What not to expect: - combat - platforming - a challenge  What to expect: - cool sound track (Jazz like I think) - Surreal art style - Funny story and dialogue - An interesting game mechanic (you basically can mind read people, steal their thoughts, 'stick' them somewhere else and use it to grab high ledges) - logical 'puzzles'  Synopsis: You are Ray, Ray has a spaghetti arm growing out of his head with which he can do the aforementioned things. Reading people's minds will unlock the 'puzzles', which are mainly get A to B to progress. Sounds boring, but the challenge is not what makes the game appealing. It's the art style, the humour, the semi-professional voice acting and the chilled sound track. It's definitely worth picking up for about 10 dollars or so and can be beaten in about 5-6 hours I'd say. There is NO replay value, however, so maybe you want to pick this up during a sale. I found it entertaining enough and got it via summer sale.

204100,Max Payne 3,"What could be a great game is marred into a good game by excessive amounts of cut scenes.  Let me first start off by stating a few things I think are important to this review:  1. I have played both Max Payne 1 and 2, at their release date many years ago. 2. I thoroughly enjoyed both MP1 and 2. 3. I picked this game up in a recent Steam Sale for I believe $5-7.99.  Max Payne 3 continues the story of the down and out protagonist, Max Payne. Max trades dark dingy warehouses for warm and sunny Brazil. The storyline and plot of MP3 is good, not great, and is fairly the standard for any sort of Noir themed shooter.  Bullet time and knocking back pain pills are still the standard for Max, and there are some incredibly theatrical, over the top shooting scenes that reminds me of films like the Expendables. Scenes that are so far fetched but still enjoyable. I mean let's be honest, the lead character's name is Max Payne. The entire Max Payne series has done really well treading the line of serious, gritty shooter along with over the top nonsensical actions similiar to Epic Games' shooter Bulletstorm.  The guns shoot and sound pretty good, the action is paced rather well with facing lots of enemies down to a handful in strategically placed locations and the pain killers (health restoration) are placed to give you enough of a challenge but to not be back breakingly difficult.  What absolutely kills me with MP3 is the 5-10 minutes of shooting followed by 2-3 minutes of cut scenes and back to shooting. More times than not Max will enter a room in a cut scene, usually near some cover and will draw attention to himself. When the player takes over the control, Max will slide into some cover and the shooting gallery will begin. Once that room is cleared, you'll walk down a hallway, rinse and repeat. This seems to be the formula more or less despite the changes in location. There's essentially one boss battle that is rather simple and uncreative. Max has a penchant for talking to himself and giving major clues away to puzzles if you don't solve them in a very short peiod of time.  Overall, I felt that Max Payne 3 was an average game. It could have been great, but the story and plot twists can become confusing, stereotypical and cliche. The shooting gallery feel is stale after the first 3-5 hours and the ending leaves alot to be desired. A disappointing release for the gaming mogul that is Rockstar who usually produces fantastic games.  Do yourself a favor and grab Max Payne for $3-5 when it goes on sale. Play it, beat it, tell your friends and uninstall it. You won't be hungry for more. I'd still recommend this game, but only for an incredibly low price tag.",1,0
48000,LIMBO,"Ultimately, not what I expected. I normally hate 2D platformers/sidescrollers because of the oversaturated market, but this was actually a good game despite its flaws (which was the inherited overhype). I think what made me respect this game was the excuse for having such a simple artstyle. That gets so abused today, but I liked this. Maybe the simplicity is what makes it what it is? At least the story anyway. The dystopian world could do with more details, but you don't always need details to send a message. Many take a really obvious explanation to the ending, but I like thinking of it much more philosophically; something everyone can relate to sometime in their life. This makes the game so much more powerful, and particularly interesting, and I believe it to be the very best way to enjoy it. Play it by yourself on a lonely evening and ponder about life as a whole. 'I swear, when did I experience something like this?' was the thought I got after every chapter. Truly wonderful.  The game as a whole I don't think is commendable other than that. The format is classic, which doesn't make it worse, but I don't understand the sacredness of it. This is just how a game should be felt like playing I think, a real game for once!",1,0

I'd just love it even more with new graphics and content. This thing gonna be cool asset for my home meetings :D  Thank you mr.developer for this gem! worths every bit of $ i paid.",1,0
208670,Blades of Time,"TL:DR – Third person hack and slash game similar to Darksiders, but very linear. There’s no significant backtracking, and all the puzzles are pretty easy to solve. You can beat the game in less than 10 hours. Technically, it has RPG elements but is extremely simplified.  In Blades of Time you play the treasure hunter Ayumi, a scantily clad, double sword wielding fighter who can kill a whole room full of armed men but can still occasionally act like Lara Croft in the Tomb Raider reboot (whiny and afraid). It’s hard to blame her though because after trying to crash her way into a mythical treasure trove, she and her sidekick Zero (a big buff dude) get thrown into Dragonland. Now separated from Zero, you (as Ayumi) need to find your way through the monster infested Dragonland back to your own world. No, Dragonland doesn’t have any dragons for you to fight, but there are a variety of creeps itching to take a bite out of all your exposed skin.  Gameplay wise, Blades of Time is a third person melee game where you can just mash the attack button and Ayumi will swing her swords like a ninja commando slashing everyone around her. However, unlike games such as Darksiders or Devil May Cry, the enemies aren’t really “stunned” by your hits and can still attack you even as they’re flinching from your strikes. Your attacks don’t interrupt them. Fortunately you have a short range dash/dodge move that you can use to evade enemy attacks. One thing I noticed is that either the enemies all have a lot of health or your sword strikes are really weak, because killing enemies takes a lot more hits than you would expect. Seriously, it takes like 20-30 hits to kill anything with your swords. You do have a rifle to shoot baddies with though, and that seems to be pretty strong.  I said before that the game is simplified, and this applies to character development and equipment. You don’t “level up” in the game, and you don’t collect money to buy items with either. As you progress through the story, you “find” new skills or upgrades to your existing ones. They’re unmissable so don’t worry about not finding an awesome spell. All of your equipment upgrades are found using a homing compass that also guides you on which direction you should be traveling. The equipment is missable, but none of it is game changing. They all just boost 1 of your skills, and nothing else (no +armor or +damage). There are only a few magic spells for you to use (fire, ice, and a heavy blast) but they add a little variety to your gameplay. They’re not especially strong either though.   Probably your greatest tool (and the reason for the game’s title) is your ability to reverse time for a short period. During the time reversal, enemies and your past self will re-enact what happened a few seconds ago. During this window you can attack the enemy with your clone for a double or even triple attack (if you reverse time in the middle of another time reversal). This is also used for puzzle solving since there are some areas that you can’t progress without hitting 2 switches at the same time (stand on switch 1 and reverse time, then stand on switch 2 while your clone is still on switch 1).   Pros: +Simple gameplay and no “research” needed. Don’t worry about character building. +The game runs smoothly despite having nice graphics for a fantasy world with magic and monsters. My computer didn’t even heat up very much.  Cons: -If you’re looking for an in-depth RPG like Dragon age, or a loot game like Diablo, Blades of Time isn’t the game for you. Also, the game’s “dialogue” is kind of weird. I don’t know if it’s translated from another language or just badly written at times. -There is this really annoying bug involving getting your spell casting “stuck” that requires a game restart to fix. It happens a lot in boss battles, and at first I didn’t even realize it was a bug. I thought I had a keyboard button jammed or something. It occurs when an enemy interrupts one of your magic spells. -The Outbreak multiplayer option plays like a third person MOBA but there’s nobody playing online. Don’t get this game for the multiplayer.  Overall, the game is fun to spend a weekend on, especially if you just want brainless hack and slash without worrying about exploring huge areas or backtracking. You also get to fight large boss monsters and earn some easy Steam achievements. 7/10 ",1,0

A slowly creeping ever-building sense of dread that compounds with each new discovery you make, pulling you deeper into this digital world and beckoning you to solve the mystery while at the same time making you wish you had never agreed to become a detective in the first place. Ethan has gone missing, and you're some sort of vague psychic that can visualize clues from the past and put them together at the scene of an incident to help point you in a direction that will hopefully lead you to the missing boy.",1,0

They show that realistic graphics dont effect the realismof the game that much. Its the simulation.The games learning curb is step or high if you look at it that way. At lest t tries. The campaign isnt that perfect but its stil good. The simulation is fantastic and is realy realistic.The interface is great and is realy easy to use which realy helps when building things.This is not a game wich you beat and then delete its one you can replay.Early acess games or games with that model should be replayable. The game is great because there is no main stratagy you just have to find it. The games mecanics are well carfted and have lots of depth. I like how you have choice.You can make a prision filled with armed gaurds and strict polices. Or you can build a reformed one. The core game sandbox mode is amazing and is the biggest part. Escape mode where you escape prisions is more of a mini game but is still fun to play.The cominity is amazing. There are so many mods.

Technology web, albeit a creative idea, is messy and not intuitive. With all this re-theming old rock-paper-scissors game into futuresque naming convention, everything became more and more unclear. UI is also clunky, I don't need any working-tile-management icon to be THAT HUGE so it blocks my view of tile yields. At one particular instance, I had to switch back and forth with city management view and regular view to be able to attend workers to correct tiles. Also, I played countless games on Civ5 and I never ever purchased a tile accidently. UI is so clunky and view-blocking in Beyond Earth that while trying to buy a resource tile, I accidently bought an adjacent tile, twice.  Also, at least twice of my advisors constantly bugged me to build miasma repulsor even though I don't have any units that could be affected by miasma. (and building one didn't make them stop, they wanted a second one immediately.) I still wonder why...  And we have a cultural advisor that advises me to research some random tech which its leaf tech would allow me to build a +1 culture producing wonder. Seriously?

Honestly I think the owner need to sell this IP off to a more robust entity that can bring it to full realization without the consumer having to learn programming.

8980,Borderlands GOTY,"It has certainly been a while since i played this game and want to say my PTSD has dropped so i guess i might as well review the game. Oh dear god no. Well i am reviewing the game in a pro / con style and ending the game with my conclusion. I want to warn you that i am review the game in 2016 not based on when it came out. You have been warned.  Pro:  The guns sound pretty cool. I really enjoy the sound of jacob snipers mainly since i played as the sniper dude primarily. Yes i really dont know how to spell his name so i am calling him the sniper dude. Regardless firing the guns felt like a treat with how the guns sound. The guns simply had a charming sound i like.   Each character you choose has their own abilities and unique perks the player could choose from. This helps separate the different play styles that can be obtained with each character such as running in killing everyone with your fists or hanging back and picking people off with your sniper.   The guns leveled up the more you used them, that was pretty cool to see that me killing enemies was worth something more than just exp and money. Now my accuracy with a sniper is even higher or i do more damage with headshot or whatever. It felt that every kill i did ment something more.  Con:  Is there a story? That is a legit question since i honestly do not know. Pretty much the game progression is mission based where you dont necessarily get plot related exposition. When i played through the game it felt that i am just doing missions and not progressing any story what so ever. I want to say you do like five or seven mission till you get to some major plot related part where you get a vault peice and then the game slows back down and that means more missions that feel there for padding. If we take out all the padding i think the game would last for like one and a half hours long.   Wall of text when accepting a mission. I dont know if this is how they explain the story or what not but no one has the time to read something that is more than a few sentences long. It kills the pacing of the game to finish killing a ton of enemies to be greeted by a large ammount of text probably used a exposition..   The wasteland is boring. What killed me more than the feeling of lack of progression is being in the wasteland for about 99% of the game. It is brown really makes me tired. I enjoy seeing more locations rather than strictly wasteland.   Was there music? Well i dont know because i turned it off after my playthrough. None of the music really stood out to me as entertaining or gave me a feeling of a cohesive atmosphere. So yea music is a negative.   Dlc was it great? Well it did add more to the story but struggled being all around interesting. Alot of bosses were just too much for one person soloing who is a sniper character. The zombie island one I will give a like since it has zombies and i certainly do enjoy a good zombie experience. Not that it was great but was something to do, slaughtering undead. Other dlc i can sum up as just meh.   Moxxies underdome....Yea that dlc is just horrible. Your in this survival mode where you kill wave on wave of enemies. Ok but that is not all says the game. You must also survive the buffs or debuffs that the player or enemies experience on every round. Now i roll my eyes in annoyance but that is not all says the game. You must survive 5 rounds made up of 5 waves each round which means a total of 25 waves. Now i slam my head against my desk but that is not all says the game. After doing that for each of the 3 respective arena's you can do it all over again but this time you will have 20 or 25 rounds made up of 5 waves per round. At this point i turn off the game to prevent the game from saying but wait there is more to this dlc. It has not story soooo why is it even here? It isnt even fun, it is a misserable chore to do.   Fires a shot from a powerful gun and get no hit even when i am aiming right at the enemy. Yea there is this nasty little issue where sometimes your bullets dont count. You fire a shot and you know you hit them but the game is like hahaha no you didnt and you just wasted some useful ammo for your most powerful gun.   Fires a shot from a powerful gun and get a damage counter of 0. I am not joking with this. It is similar to the issue just above but this time i get an indication i hit them and the damage i see is 0. I am a higher level than the enemy and using a higher level gun but still manage to get a damage output of 0.  Conclusion:  This game was just too much for me to do. After i got my 100% list i was done and took a break from it. I should of done a review earlier but had PTSD from the game. I can not recommend the game for 2 reasons. 1 all the issues i pointed out in my list. 2 if you get borderlands 2; it has a story and gives a really brief segment about what happened in borderlands 1. So with that you can skip the game entirely and not be confused about the sequal. Again this game probably was good way back then but now it just is not, i recommend borderlands 2 over this because it is in everyway better. Good to see the developers took peieces of this game and made a master peice with it's sequal.",-1,1

Note that the game has been regularly augmented and now has more features than many reviews based on the initial release don't mention. for exmaple more characters and more maps.  + easy control, with 4 actions buttons, no need to have twelve fingers per hand, nor too learn difficult combos sequences. + simple easy to understand rules, let you jump right into action and focus on playing. + good art direction with colourful characters cast, and an humorous tone. + decent AI, making solo training quite interesting.

It starts off easy, and becomes more and more complicated.  The story itself is very, very good. It introduces you to the world of Hacknet, and then lets you do your thing, towards the end the story garbs you again and you dicover the fate of Bit.

234190,Receiver,"Great mechanics. The game throws you into a survival situation with a gun of random type in an unknown state and asks you to deal with it using detailed gun operation mechanics. It's difficult to remember all the buttons, as there is one for releasing the magazine, one for loading, one for cocking the hammer, one for toggling the safety, one for inserting magazine, one button for each storage space in the inventory, and one button which consistently drops the magazine you just released to the ground, forcing you to pick it up again using a different button(and with a released magazine the layout changes). Combining these into fluid gun operation is hard, and that's the point. This is not a point-and-click fps like call of duty which supplies you with a handy 'make gun ready for firing'-button and a big nice crosshair floating in the middle of the screen. Everything you do is exactly as it would be in real life using a real handgun. You even need to put your gun away when you load rounds into a magazine.   I do have some problems with the game though. First, it's a bit repetitive and bland. You face two different enemies through the game, and both are instant death unless you're lucky. It's realistic and makes for a good demonstration of the mechanics(and the message behind it), but it doesn't work very well as a game. Secondly, the main objective of the game, which is finding 11 cassette tapes providing you with the backstory for the setting, is impossible. Most of my attempts I die after having found exactly 0 tapes. You can search through miles of this building and never find a tape. The most I've found was 3 I think. It's not worth the attempt to go for all 11, so with the main objective being moot, the mechanics is all there really is to the game. Thirdly, the end goal of any game should simply not be to reveal the exposition. According to what you learn underway, you are a survivor of some extradimensional genocide of the human race, conditioned to fight back against them. However, as far as I can tell(as I haven't found all the tapes before), you fighting back doesn't really have much of a purpose. You don't save the human race, as they are all gone, you don't deliver a blow to them that serves as phyrric victory, you don't even get to kill a single one of them. You are just a special agent trained to survive the initial massacre so you could starve to death a bit later. So the storytelling doesn't work very well and mostly serves to confuse.   Now, I do realize that my criticism is a bit irrelevant considering the purpose and format of the game(and the fair price). The reason for my criticism is simply because I really, REALLY want to see this concept developed further.   If this game was a filled-in roguelike akin to the binding of isaac, with permanent and temporary upgrades, special items, more enemies, more varied areas and with a more direct purpose, this could be an amazing game. I believe this would be entirely possible without breaking with the principles behind the game. For example, you start with the 1911 and some bullets, then while you learn the game mechanics you earn a temporary upgrade, let's say a fluorescent front sight or a magazine of hollow point bullets(giving a high chance of disabling an enemy without a critical hit maybe?). Then you find a tape and unlock a permanent upgrade, the ability to sense whether an enemy is within a certain distance(that's sort of the stuff I would imagine considering the whole 'mentally conditioned to deal with the invaders from another dimension' thing. It could be as simple as unlocking the ability to hear them better, which is one of the things that bothered me. *silence* BEEP BANG *death*). Next run you use your new ability to gain 10 enemy kills without dying and it rewards you with a new gun which you can start with or find during a run. Then maybe as you gain achievements or find things, you unlock new items you can find(and therefore the chances of finding anything), or maybe the chances of starting a run with rarer items, or unlocking a bulletproof vest which has a 80% chance of absorbing a hit and a 40% chance of being broken each time it does. It should lead somewhere and feel like you are improving and progressing. There are a lot of things you can do with this concept, and the rogue-like format is what it's already going for, so that's just an example. I want it to have value as a game, because as a simple gun simulator the whole procedurally generated stuff and backstory is pretty wasted on it. Another potential use for the mechanics is as a proper gun-range simulator, which could be a great way to learn about gun operation and safety(I imagine with instructors who throw you out if you don't use proper safety precautions). In that case there would have to be a lot of different weapons and more realistic aiming(with the steadying and holding your breath and that whole thing).  Tl;dr: The mechanics are excellent, but the game they are used for isn't. I want to see a good game using the same amazing mechanics, and so do you.  Oh, and let me hold shift to run.",1,0

22380,Fallout: New Vegas,"Fallout: New Vegas was my introduction to the Fallout Series and is a truly remarkable game. My review may be short but I hope it helps those on the fence about trying this game to either play it or not.  Graphics: I'll start with these, while they are probably a bit dated by today's standards, I find they still hold up rather well. The environments are interesting and detailed.  Gameplay: This is the meat of any game in my opinion and I find the gameplay in Fallout: New Vegas second to none. Controls are responsive, easy to master and plain fun. Everything just works and I find that a refreshing change from most games with strange controls and shakey cameras.  Storyline: You are a Courier for the Mojave Express delivering a package when you are set upon by a group of Tribals and a man in a Fancy Suit. Overpowered you are defenseless as they steal your package and leave you in a shallow grave. You are rescued and tended to by a friendly Doctor in the small town of Goodsprings, that is where your quest for answers and vengeance begins.   The Storyline takes many twists and turns and there are seemingly an endless amount of people, groups and larger forces that need your help. You will never lack for something to do in the Mojave and there are many interesting things to be found out there in the Wasteland.  Issues I have with the game: This game is incredibly unstable in its vanilla form, however there are many mods out there that fix such issues and allow for a smoother gameplay experience. I've refrained from mentioning mods in this review because it should be about the base game, but with a game like this it is difficult not to. Some of the major community made bugfixes and stability mods should almost be considered mandatory, so if you decide to try this game I advise you to look into them.  Overall Impression: This is a finely crafted, yet buggy and unstable game that is incredibly fun to play, a still highly active modding community keeps adding fresh content to the game. I would highly suggest this game as it is an experience you will not soon forget. Memorable characters, exciting gameplay and interesting twists during the story keep it fresh for a long time.  Update: Still great.",1,0

311730,Dead or Alive 5 Last Round,"I think this is Tecmo's first major game on the PC, alot of people are down voting it, I'll respect their opinions but I will ultimately up vote this game.  Since it is their first venture into the PC, the optimization is very well done, on maxed out settings albeit limited settings and at 1080p it runs at 60fps all the time on a AMD Phenom II X4 940, 2 GB DDR2 and GTX 670.  Pros: DOA on PC Easy support for SweetFX Graphics are the same as PS4/XBone as seen in this helpful video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LcYNItNuak&amp;hd=1  The shading/lighting and object details are on par with PS4/Xbone and is a substantial upgrade from the last gen versions. The absence of the soft engine, whatever that does, is minimal at best.  The down sides are: You cannot remap keyboard controls No online for now, to be patched within 3 months. This isn't a big deal for me as I am a single player gamer DLC prices are extremely high Lack of SteamWorks (acheivements, cards, cloud save)  I have been wanting more major console games on the PC becuase I get the best of both worlds, games of various genres instead of the typical shooter or puzzler and the freedom of graphical customization. There has been a rush of major fighting franchises coming to the PC, starting with Street Fighter and more recently with Mortal Kombat. Yes, those 2 titles did have a better release than DOA5 but I will relate this release to the Dark Souls PC release. Even though the release is flawed, it is better than not having it at all. With time, lessons will be learned, I hope that patches will remedy the launch issues everyone is highligting or that the release of the next DOA is a better one.  It is great to have the DOA franchise finally on the PC, with Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and the upcoming Tekken 7, there will be a fighting game to fit gamers play styles.",1,0

I don't understand why it works the computer so hard just loading up the lobby interface. Any email that comes in would pull me out of the game, and alt-tabbing to re-enter the match would fail re-rez. So I end up with a 640x480 screen of messed up graphics and have to shut down. Restarting and re-entering would crash me further - when it finally works I cannot rejoin the game I got dropped out of 1 minute ago.

310950,Street Fighter V,"Update 2/18  Updating this review now that many server issues have been addressed.   Pros:   Looks Great: No frame rate issue from my computer. Game looks nice  Plays Well: If you played USF4 then you kinda know what your getting into. Game on the surface feels similar but the more you play the more the difference come out.   Lots of promise: Capcom is looking to support this game long term and there are 6 characters promised. No matter how you feel about the pay/grind gate, this game looks like its going to have a lot of characters and be supported for a while, and hey, that costs money guys.  The game shows hope now but still needs time. Its a fun play but...  Cons:   Long loading time for online play: Once you find an oppenent the game will essentailly freeze for about 20 -30 seconds sometimes a bit longer before launching you into online match.   Matching can(rarely for me) be a bit laggy: Honestly not a huge problem for me but occasionally you will come against someone who seems to have bad internet and they'll lag. Seems better then SF4 though.  Online Lobbys 2 Man until March: Probably for server stability or otherwise haven't built out all the features yet but online lobbies are limited to 2 people. There is not spectator option. Only really a problem if you have a bunch of friends you want to play with.  Limited Single Player Options: The story is not yet fully completed will take about 2 hours to complete all the missions for all 16 characters. After that your left with survival and training. Survival is just match after match and is used to unlock bonus colors, and training is training.   Over all I think the game shows some promise. Given a few months the game will be filled out and it most if not all my complaints will be address. I'll try and remember to update this review in march.",1,0

Pros: - True RPG • A lot of well written dialogue • Choice, choice, choice • Atmosphere of great, gloomy and in the same time outstanding world • Interesting npcs • Great story • Great items and loot • Levelling system up to the mark • Intensive dialogue (yes, again) that is more than well written – I enjoyed every word! - Voice acting is really great! It is something I missed off the all dialogues in BG. - Graphics  - Perspective – 3rd person perspective from above to control your team – God! how I missed that! - Music - Detailed locations - Castle and its defences - Fighting system I like - Back to old school – nothing is lacking. It is so superior over the other tries (ex. Divinity Original Sin and its tedious-plastic dialogues) to make a true RPG game   Cons: - Hnmmm, the world is a bit too small for my liking. - Maybe a level cap is too low? - Building all these defences in your Stronghold feels a bit pointless.

216110,Tiny Troopers,"5/10  It is clearly inspired by Cannon Fodder, but has a lower level of fun. It is fun until it last, being a bit too short and not that challenging. I've completed the campaign once and I suspect that playing it again would make it harder (there is a red '+' now) but I'm not so motivated to play it. There is a zombie mode (endless hordes) but it is less fun than expected, you are forced to stay in a very tight area and you die more cause you're stuck on some structure than for the enemies surrounding you.  Not worth 5 euro - but definitely yes when on sale at much lower price.",-1,0

301910,Saints Row: Gat out of Hell,"Basically SR4, but with a lower price, shorter campaign and less depth. Honestly it feels less like a game and more like a testing ground for some gameplay ideas that Volition could't fit into their other games. To be fair, the ideas are actually pretty good, like collectible weapons, ally-summoning and the Angel wings.  Pros: - Low(er) price - Cool gameplay - Good writing (as always in this series) - Interesting sandbox map - Varied enemies - Badass weapons - Interesting challenges - New Saint's crew member - Experiments with new art style - Shoot the devil in the face  Cons: - Shorter game - Lack of traditional missions - Lack of customisation - Not as deep as previous games - Smaller map - ♥♥♥♥♥ ending(s) - Non-animated cutscenes - Only got to shoot the devil in the face once  It's a fun game, and I got my money's worth. But that might only be because I'm invested in the series, and someone who's not played the previous games is probably going to wonder what the point of the game is.",1,0

The extended support and DLC being added to the game by the developers frequently and more than a year after its release makes it one to pick up on sale.",1,0
248820,Risk of Rain,"If you like rougelikes then you will like Risk of Rain. It has 10 classes to choose from each going for a completely different playing style. It works like this. You wake up from a crashed pod in either The dried lake or The Desolate Forest. You go around killing what spawns and the level is randomized, now sometimes the level looks almost completely the same as another time you played it HOWEVER it will NEVER have the same chests and definitly never have the same items because there are 100+ items. So you find the teleporter and For the next 90 seconds (or 120 on monsoon difficulty) enemys will spawn rapidly and at least 1 boss will spawn. at the end of the 90 seconds you kill everything left on the screen then you can go to the teleporter and you can teleport to the next level. But before we go there I need to tell you about the items and chests system. The items and chests system is easy, you get some money from killing any monster and you get some money if you open up these containers that are just sitting around. You spend money to open chests, for example on the 1st level you pay 25 for a small chest and 50 for a large chest. Im still not sure how it increases from there because on the 2nd level I will have small chests costing 78 one time and the next they cost 53. Every time you open a chest you get 1 random item from a pool of items im not sure how much you start with but when you complete achievements you can unlock more items to get. When you go to the 2nd level it can be either the Damp Caverns or the Sky meadow and you do prettymuch the same thing as the 1st level. find teleporter, survive for 90 seconds, kill all enemys, and go to next level. and level 3 is prettymuch the same and so is level 4 and 5 however the 6th... well ill just let you figure that out.  As time goes on the difficulty gets harder at about 5 minutes the difficulty increases from very easy to easy then later to medium then to hard then to impossible then to some funny things ill let you figure out yourself  The multiplayer works well so long as you know how to port forward if you don't know what that is then go look up 'Risk of Rain how to set up a server' and you should find something to help you.   Overall very good game 8/10  ",1,0

230410,Warframe,"Warframe is an impressive work of a game. You might think, just by looking at its store page with the 'Free to Play' tag and the 'dlc(?)' packs underneath that it's Pay to Win. That is not the case. Not even a little bit. You can obtain everything non-cosmetic in the game without paying a dime. You can even trade rare items for the in-game currency, platinum. So you really can get everything without paying.  You start off with little, taking a weapon of choice for a Primary, Secondary and a Melee weapon, as well as one of three Warframes. Your Warframe has certain abilities that set it aside from others. As you master your weapons and Warframe, The Lotus takes notice and allows you to test your abilities and Rank Up. After you've ranked up, you now have access to better weaponry to take on bigger things.  The mission variety is good, the amount of weapons can be overwhelming, but there's always something to do. Give this game a shot. DE is an excellent company, they do livestreams every other Friday(could be mistaken on schedule) and talk about what's going on, what they're working on and what they want to do. They listen to feedback from everywhere; Steam Forums(ugh), their own forums, or even Reddit. They are not a greedy company. Give the game a try, it's pretty fun.",1,1

43110,,"Virtually perfect blend of survival-horror, shooter, and storytelling. You can't get any better than this.  Based on the novel by the same name, Metro 2033, it tells an epic tale of survival in the Russian wasteland that used to be Moscow and the Metro system below, where one must survive the horrors that lurk inside, as well as fellow human beings.  Memorable characters, immersive gameplay, enchanting environments, and some of the most badass creatures you'll ever see.  As suggested to me by a friend, play the game with Russian audio and English subtitles for the fullest experience, as the novel was Russian to begin with, and the Russian voices sound much better than any of the others in my opinion.  Hands down, this has become my favorite game that is based on a novel, and my favorite game in its genres.",1,0

353700,The Deadly Tower of Monsters,"Must have game if you like comedy, satire and science fiction movies. Narration is top notch and unlike some other games where death scenes just get a 'That wasn't what happened' or a rehash of it, in this one there's a backstory for death scenes too. Frankly I was very impressed by that. The writing is great and the voice acting by the director just makes it all the more better.  Gameplay wise it is a top down thing, you can carry 2 ranged and 2 melee weapons plus there's character specific abilities. If you fall unexpectedly you can always teleport back to the point where you dropped from. Same applies if you fail to land where you wanted to, you can just hit 'C' and try the jump again.  Given its low price I'd say buy it even if there's no sale, it's that enjoyable.",1,0

However all this fun is ruined by a greedy company (think its called kabam) that comes along and makes ingame money that you pay for with shops that have items you can only get through the ingame money... this would be amazing if that company didn't come along.

453770,Forgotten Tales: Day of the Dead,"  Fogotten Tales: Day of the Dead ---------------------------------------------------------------- Fogotten Tales: Day of the Dead Is a nice Solitaire Game. I have played 3 others on steam, 1 not so good, one pretty good, and one very good, I would rank this one up there with the one that is very good. I love the whole day of the dead theme, it works very well. One of the biggest pluses this has over other solitaire games is Achievements and Trading Cards, this may seem like something small, but I can stress enough how much this is a deal breaking in buying games to myself and lots of others. The Artwork looks high def and done very well, nice vibrant colors, My only dislike with the artwork is the way the Main guy is drawn, he just seems so very plain, maybe give him a little more style?  The music seems to go well with the game too, was not once annoyed by it lol The power ups are a great touch and I can't see myself playing solitaire without them now lol I like the way the game progresses, and the fact that it actually has a storyline unlike some games. The game seems a little easier compared to some other solitaire games i\'ve played, like I always seem to get the cards I need before it ends, Ran through the first 10 levels pretty fast, and had a perfect chapter, but none the less, I very much enjoyed this one down to the nitty gritty.  The game seems to have a TON of levels, so I assume its going to get harder As I progress. I honestly can\'t think of anything bad to say about it other than it should have a regular solitaire mode option as well, and that it can seem to easy sometimes. Overall a Great Game.    Pros: + Achievements + Trading Cards + Not too Difficult + Great Art  + Power ups + An Actual Story line + LOTS of Levels  + Decent Music  Cons:  - Almost feels a little too easy sometimes? - Should have a REGULAR Solitaire mode as well.

15100,Assassin's Creed,"A truly revolutionay game. The locales are vast, exotic, and intriguing. The game does an excellent job of sticking to it's goal: assassinations, but on the side note it is rediculously fun to run around on rooftops and climb towers, churches, mosques, castles, EVERYTHING. It's almost more fun to climb around than actually assassinate the targets. On the negative side, the missions involving finding information about your target are rather redundant and there is no real reward (besides a save point) to spending time looking for all those flags. Also the game requires a powerful machine if played on PC due to it's hardcore spec requirements. Otherwise, a masterful, enchanting, and must-play game",1,0

337930,Nameless ~The one thing you must recall~,"Definitely recommended.  Mystery and romance. That pretty much sums the game up without revealing too much. It also has fantasy elements to it, but the game is much more than that. The plot is interesting enough with just the mystery, fantasy and romance itself. However, the story is much deeper than that. It deals with issues that anyone of us could have, has had or might be having right now. That is what makes things game impactful. It might make you think. It might make you laugh. It might make you uncomfortable. And it might make you cry. But it's all worth it, when you finally finish that last ending.  Others have noted the same thing that I'm about to say now; even if one of them wasn't your type, most likely you'll like them all at the end. They're a nice set of characters fit for different tastes. All of them grow so much mentally and yet they still can keep that one thing that first drew me to them. They all have issues and they overcome them, not just the romanceable characters but also the heroine herself. The side characters were awesome too, so even if your chosen bishie isn't on the screen, you're most likely to enjoy your time anyway.  While I do like the art, it's not the prettiest one I've seen. Game graphics and art are what first draw me to a game. This game's art is indeed really nice, but CGs looked a bit... awkward at some points. But I'm picky when it comes to game art, so don't let it push you away from this game. It still looks really nice.  Voice acting was great. Really great. I don't understand Korean, so when one word ends and another begins put me off a bit at first. Especially if I'm trying to hear whether the voice ended or just pausing for an effect. But for me, who always keeps voices on (even the annoying ones), it's part of the appeal.  Now, that one minus part. This game has quite a few typos. It's not noticeable all the time, but you might laugh at a bit inappropriate time. But consindering it's only a one minus part, I learned to ignore it.  With only that one minus part, I can definitely recommend the game. The story is deep on the long run, the characters (hopefully) can stir your heart and it leaves an impression on you. The price might be a bit high, but there's always a game that costs even more. I got in on a sale but I saved only a few euros, so it doesn't make much difference. The game is worth the money. All of it.",1,0
305740,Pitiri 1977,"Pitiri is a short entertaining adventure platformer that you can quickly beat. But even if it is short, there was a lot of dedication and passion during the creation of the game.  The levels are gorgeous and well throughout. The music I actually listened to (Most of the time, I turn off the sounds, play the game, and watch Netflix... not this time), and it was great.   Some Cons: One thing that really bothers me is that there is no controller support. The devs have said they have no time, since October of 14... Perhaps sooner, I didn't dig enough into the forums to see how long ago people were complaining about it.  They added windowed support... after a fashion. I can't move the window. It's stuck in the center of my screen. Might as well have left it full screen.   There is little instruction on how your various powers work, and sometimes you can get lost in spots if you don't see something, but overall, the game is highly entertaining for an hour, till you beat it.  There is also a sandbox mode so you can create your own levels, but that seemed to be more effort than it was worth... at least for me.  Where I have issues is the price. I know they just dropped the price to $4, and I understand that they spent a lot of time, working on the beautiful levels, and the music, but the game is extremely short. I'd recommend this game for a lower price personally.   Oh, and the game DOES have trading cards, even though the store page doesn't list them. 3 card drops. Devs never updated it?  Overall, I'd still give the game an 7 out of 10.  Seeing as how short it is, you can last without controller support, but it does make it less fun.",1,0

296470,Mount Your Friends,"I can clearly say that this game changed my life.  You see, many people underestimate the power and sheer manliness that emanates from one's dong. This game will change your life. It is not only one of the best sports simulators out there, Mount Your Friends is a game about overcoming lifes's biggest difficulties. It is about improving and getting better at being yourself. At being a man. I have naver found so much power on the sound of a dong dangling loose, and never before such helicopterism had been seen. I feel much better now as a man. Yesterday I was in a turkish bath and attempted to show off how manly I got.  The other men ran away from the sheer ferocity of my manhood dangling and helicopterizing the hormones that lied dormant deep inside of me.  Be ready to see life from a new perspective.",1,0

281990,Stellaris,"This game is great until you encounter other species. You'll be lucky if they're only superior in every way to you. Most of the time they're overwhelmingly more powerful than you, even if you just send ships to find aliens right away at the beginning of the game.  Managing 'sectors' is also impossibly complex. Even with the tutorial on full blast, there are things that they neglect to cover. Like what the hell you're supposed to do about the fact that a sector doesn't have certain resources. You apparently don't get any resources from that sector until they have enough to sustain themselves. But you also can't manage anything inside of a sector, so ♥♥♥♥ off if you think you're going to be able to fix the problem. What's that? Just colonize a planet in a nearby star system and assign that system to the sector?  That would be great, if habitable planets were common place. But they're not. Oh? Terraform them? I've played through this game (as far as I can go, anyways) about 6 times now. Terraforming is a dream that you can acheive pretty much only by chance. If you don't acheive it, sectors screw you, the limited number of planets screw you, and you're basically stuck in a death spiral where all you can do is research things, and hope no one gets irritated with your race.  What's that? There's a diplomacy screen? Ah yes, the diplomacy screen is basically decorative. In the time I've played this game there has been absolutely nothing I could do to make a race that was upset with me even a fraction less hostile towards me.  And to top it all off, the interface needs a SERIOUS overhaul. If I set the game down for a while and come back to it, I need the full tutorial, because there are certain features which are buried in the interface and cannot be found unless you are directed to them.   The early game starts out great. But fairly soon after you start hitting the limit of planets you can manually control (which is a set limit, it's not something the game just lets you decide for yourself), the game is pretty much over. Which is super sad, because the beginning of the game is a lot of fun.",-1,1

260430,The Four Kings Casino and Slots,"I really wanted to like this game. I'm a big fan of casino games in general. I don't gamble much in real life, but it's nice to be able to have fun with little expense. Unfortunately, this game didn't really fit the bill. From a social aspect, it's fine. Most of the people are nice. The rest of the game though, is severely lacking.   Poker has the same problem it has anywhere else. It's free. People still make boneheaded calls and go all-in with nothing. The bigger problem is that the only tournament you can play is with 6 people at one table. You start with $50k which would be fine if the blinds didn't go up extremely fast. It makes trying to play a realistic game of poker virtually impossible, as very soon after starting you're pretty much pot committed once you bet anything.  Blackjack is probably the best part of the game though, especially after the last update, it literally feels like the dealer is getting 20 or 21 every other hand. Still, there is money to be made if you know how to play.  That brings me to the worst part of the game, table machines. Slots, keno, video blackjack and video poker are money suckers with what seems like much lower payout percentages than even Vegas. I literally sat there for 30-45 minutes without a single bonus round. Forget trying to bet anything higher than the minimum because you will soon be out of money. There are only three types of slot machines which gets old really fast especially when none of them pay. Keno has a minimum bet of $100 and video blackjack has a minimum of $200. With poor payouts, again you will be out of money quickly. The game also has war, roulette, big wheel, craps and bingo which are all pretty standard. Again, especially with war, it seems like the more money bet, the lower percentage of times you're going to win.  You have daily tasks to do, receiving $200 for each of the 6. Unfortunately, most of the time you will be spending more than that to complete the tasks. There are weekly tasks, mostly revolving around getting a certain amount of XP. An example of the problem with this is me spending 45 minutes playing a $400 per spin slot machine, losing 40k and gaining a whopping 200xp. That would have been great if the weekly task wasn't 1,000 XP with a few thousand reward for doing so. There is a VIP section for high rollers but I honestly don't know how people get to be high rollers unless they have spent real money or gotten extremely lucky.   Again, I really wanted to like the game. Unforunately, there is better poker to be had on any online site and the rest of the game is just no fun with the extremely low payouts. If you're just in it for the social aspect and don't mind betting small, go for it. Otherwise, I'd stick with other products.",-1,0

215630,Demonicon,"TLDR: Decent closed-world single character action RPG, which doesn't offer the free roam of open world RPGs (different genre if you ask me) but story reacts to your choices.   Pretty good voice acting and dialoges, decent story, acceptable combat. Skill tree gives you some options, but you are pretty much stuck with being mage-warrior. It is quite fun and kept me in front of screen til 5 AM the first day I played. Lack of manual saves is a little annoying, but the games is saved almost on every zone entrance. When we are talking about zones, there are not that many and you will be returning to the same zones, but it offers enough variablity to not become dull. In conclusion, very enjoyable 20+ hours. If you can get it below 10 EUR, go for it, and if you are a completitionist, start on hard difficulty so you can unlock the next one after you finish the game.",1,0

Plenty of weapons to kill zombies with, 8 boss encounters, different difficulty modes, and surprisingly one of the best video game soundtracks I have ever heard. Completely varied with a mixture of ambient to groovy, and other genres I have no clue about, but completely enjoyed. The last level alone is worth the few bucks in my opinion. The only thing I disliked about this game was the storyline and dialogue. The humor was outrageous and just sad at times. None the less, I really enjoyed everything else about it.

242860,Verdun,"I was going to write a positive review but after a while of playing Verdun I decided not to and here are the main resone for it is the over-complicated squad system.  For such a simple game the developers of Verdun decided that you will only level your squad IF you play with the same people that you played the first time in that squad. If right now you are asking your self  '...what?'  then read a guide on the squad system XP and it's leveling. If you are still asking your self after reading said guide '...but why?' then Verdun is not for you.  Just like in RO2 you will die a lot everyone is a sniper unless you are the NCO then you have only your pistlo a mortar/gas call lin or recon plane. Again your calss progression is tied with your squad XP. Did I mention that when the game came out of EA, Dev's did not wiped squad XP and you will see people with level 100 and maxed squads so good luck with that.  ",-1,1

35450,Rising Storm/Red Orchestra 2 Multiplayer,"Red Orchestra 2 is a fantastic fps game.  Like few others, it walks the dangerous tightrope between realism and arcadey fun. The high respawn rate and massive waves means that the game is not as tense as games like 'Insurgency' but is much much faster-paced. It can be frustrating in early playthroughs as you die very quickly - especially to unseen enemies - but slowly, you can learn ways of keeping yourself safe from enemy fire.  The class system works best when there are large teams with players filling each role. Most players are riflemen, restricted to their humble bolt-action rifle and explosive grenades. It can be very tempting to move to classes with cooler toys but these often come with more responsibilities like commanding squads, spotting enemies, calling in artillery and mortar fire, and laying smoke. This reflects the real-life structure of these armies and is a more subtle counterpart to Overwatch or TF2 style class system.  Maps have wide degrees of variety and encourage all sorts of game play. There are many avenues for attack and defense and, within a single map, change from wide open spaces to dense city streets or even firefights within single large buildings such as the grain elevator. They also eschew the tendency for drab greyness, and manage to create realism with a bright colour palette from time to time, especially in rising storm.  If you: - enjoy military realism - want fast-paced tactical team action - have patience for challenging mechanics - enjoy the feeling of being in a large scale battle BUY THIS GAME",1,1
224260,No More Room in Hell,"Highly recommend playing NMRiH to all people. The game has a great immersion factor that other zombie games (such as Left 4 Dead) don't have, such as the feeling that you could die any moment from anything.

322920,theHunter: Primal,"The game is not really a survival game but more of a hunting game where you are a forced hunter simply to stay alive on a planet you have been dumped on. So a better tag would be 'hunting simulator'. If you try to run and gun you will die most times although in ceratin cases you can do this. The weapons are geared towards hunting not a frantic FPS experience. Strategy and tactics are needed to survive in this game initially but once you get a handle on the controls of the guns, body movement,crouch and prone and then stand again you will be a master hunter. Did I say you are hunting dinosaurs? The devs did not abandoned the game but are adding updates slowly because their main game is 'theHunter'. In december of 2015 the devs added new weapons and a new Primal dinosaur and also with it came several bugs they need to fix. The game is good at its core and looks beautiful so have patiences with it and enjoy it for what it is until they add more dinos and other stuff whatever that may be and whenever that may be. If it has the support they will continue to make it a great game. FOR THE PRICE or on sale it is worth doing all the achievements and hopefully finding your first gold T-rex so you can summon a Primal T-rex. Remember it is not a run and gun game. It will be hard when you first start off. Explore the map and die if you must looking for settlements. Once you learn the map things will be easier to find. Crates have stuff you can use but only settlements have the weapons and camo. Have fun and happy hunting.  April 2016 Review: A game still worth playing if you like simulators. Don't compare it to any other game where you can just blow off bullets or 1 headshot kill an enemy or animal. The devs have it the way it is so you have use some skill to prevail. It is not am MMO so there isn't any quirky stuff like mounts and taming. It is for mature people mostly but kids can enjoy it too as long as they see it for what it is: A HUNTING SIMULATOR where you have to work for your stuff and learn to be good at it. I even had a negative comment about the game on my Youtube page about 'if you can't headshot a dinosaur in the brain once then the game sucks' or something similar to that. What shallow thinking. What idiocy. The game is good but still has bugs but if you have a good system to play on the bugs don't seem to fly as much. Therefore, it is still worth the price and if it is on sale definately get it. It has COOP so playing with friends is fun too.   HAPPY HUNTING (Look for my videos on Google : GameCookerUSRocks)",1,0

The controls are not intuitive and allows for background items like trees to block your ability to interract with the maps. Occasionally a click to a specific square will instead rocket your selected unit across the map somewhere else.  The part that is most frustrating was that during the time the game was being developed and kickstarted requirements, while never confirmed, were said to be within the normal performance for games of these era. Guild Wars 2 at full effects or FFXIV: ARR, no problem on my system. Warmachine Tactics however ends it. Its been 7 months with only minimal improvement on the stability end.

221640,Super Hexagon,"This isn't one of those games that you will just sit down and play hours on end with, but it is still very addicting.

255420,,"If I could give this a sideways thumb, I would. It's meh at best. Read to conclusion/TL;DR if you don't want to read the review. My thumbs-up is only because I like MTG. Overall rating? 6.25/10  If you are a hardcore MTG player, this isn't the game for you at all. I got this game because I wanted to reminisce on my days in middle school when I played this game to the extreme. Given that, I recommend this game for the casual player/those that don't want to collect cards and take up space/newbie players just learning. Having said that, there's some serious kinks in this game. The menu icons, SLOW AS ALL GET OUT. Painfully almost. The graphics look great, but that comes at a price; speed. The instant menu features were way better. Also, just skip the tutorial if you've played before, you don't really need it. The 2-headed giant was a fun mode they got rid of, which major sucks too. Sometimes, I scratch my head at it. This is a cool game if you want to just get into basic deck mechanics, see all the new cards, and just have fun with it. But this game SERIOUSLY lacks from an enthusiast point of view (I used to be an enthusiast). You have to win almost everything to unlock cards...which is okay I guess, but there are some points where you have to redo your colors just to get past certain enemies. Also, you don't get access to any other sets with this. That's my worst complaint about this game. I liked some of the older stuff; 7th edition. I got beat in a tournament because some guy used cards from '93 and had a card called Timewalk, where you could take another turn. Granted, that card back then was wroth like hundreds of dollars, but still...it would be nice to incorporate some of the older serieses into this so we can get a TRUE experience. Also, be ready to restart a LOT. If you don't draw the best hand, you WILL lose. You will need to grind for a long time to build up your library, so be prepared to put some work in if you want to succeed at trouncing people and AI. At least they gave us deck customization (finally?) I've been playing on Archmage difficulty, and it's really stacked against you starting out, but it gets better as you go on. You will probably also need (at some point) to buy the card collections, which is a business tactic to help Wizards out since you aren't buying actual booster packs. HAVING SAID ALL THAT, it seems like the cons outweigh the pros. But if you're just casually looking for some once-in-awhile fun chillin' with a Magic deck, this saves a LOT of heartache with regards to buying cards, deck protectors, travelling to tournaments, dealing with the weird ♥♥♥ zealots who take it too seriously. Nothing wrong with that per se, I'm just not that kind of player.     Conclusion/TL;DR: Buy this if you're a casual gamer, don't mind spending $5 every once in a rare while (people need to chill on 'pay to win', it's more like 'pay to make your chances only slightly better', which sucks but they're a company and that's what they do), and you don't want to deal with the hassle of the real game...BUT wait until it's on sale. I didn't mind spending $10 on this game, but I'd advise until it hits 50% off, then you can buy the game and a few card collections for the same price and have a much better experience starting out AND grinding out.",1,0

440,Team Fortress 2,"Team Fortress 2 is a team-based, first-person shooter multiplayer computer game developed by valve. It is the successful sequel to Tream Fortress Classic. It first came out in a compilation called The Orange Box, which is no longer avaliable. As of 2011, Team Fortress 2 is a free to play game, where you can upgrade to premium via purchasing something from the Team Fortress 2 in-game store.  Gameplay:  This fun game is based on two oppisite teams, Builders League United, often refered to as BLU team. And RED team, Reliable Excavation and Demolition. Players can choose to play as one of the nine character classes in these teams each with their own unique strenghts, weaknesses and weapons. Each class consist of a primary weapon, a secondary weapon, and a melee weapon. Although certain classes contain PDA's and other unique items. Team Fortress 2 was released with six offical maps, but many more maps have been added. A neat little addition to this game is 'The Administrator' a woman announces different game events over PA or Loudspeaker, so that everyone in the game can hear it. Stats are a extreamly nice addition to this game, where time played as a certain class, most kills as that class and most objectives achived in that life, etc...  Game Modes: -In Capture the Flag maps, the objective for both teams is to obtain a briefcase of intelligence from the enemy team's base and return it to their own base while preventing the opposing team from doing the same. The player carrying the intelligence can be killed to drop the briefcase, or the player can willingly drop it; in either case this starts a brief timer. A team can only score by delivering the enemy's intelligence to their base. A match lasts until one team scores a set number of points or time runs out. A variant of Capture the Flag, called Special Delivery, has teams vying over a single briefcase to attempt to deliver to a common target. Once the intelligence is picked up by one team, only members of that team can carry it until either it successfully delivered, or the drop timer expires and it is returned to its original spawn point.   -Control Point modes are more varied in their objectives, but share the common aim of capturing a particular point on the map by having one or more team members stay on the point without the presence of the opposing team for a short period of time. In standard control point maps, each team already controls an equal number of points, with one additional point left unclaimed; teams can only attempt to capture points that are nearest to those points they already control. Each team attempts to progressively capture all the control points to win the round. In attack/defend-style maps, the RED team already controls all the points on the map, and must hold these points from being captured by the opposing team (BLU Team) for a length of time. Attack/defend-style maps can come in either single-round or multiple-round maps; Rounds past the first will only be played if BLU wins a round.  -Territorial control is a more complex version of Control Point, in which each map is divided into a number of closed sections, held between the two teams. Each round has one team attempting to seize control of the opposing team's capture point for that section in a fixed amount of time. Once a team holds all but the enemy's home base point, they then attempt to capture the enemy base point while the enemy defends for a fixed amount of time.  -King of the Hill features a single control point in the center of the map, with teams vying for control over it. The control point is locked for a set amount of time after the round start. Once the point is unlocked, either team can capture it. Capturing the control point starts the team's clock counting down. The clock that is currently counting down will only stop if the other team captures the point, the clock reaches 0:00, or another map-specific event occurs such as a Halloween boss spawning during the Halloween event. Teams win the round when their clock reaches 0:00 with the control point currently under their control. If the other team is capturing the point, the round will not end until the point's capture progress resets to 0.  -Payload maps feature a length of track atop which sits a bomb mounted on a cart. These maps come in two varieties. In normal Payload maps, one team must escort the cart through a series of checkpoints in a limited amount of time to reach a final target that the other team defends. The cart moves when one or more players of the team are near it without enemies nearby; during this, the cart heals and provides ammo to those close by. If no one is by the cart, it may move backwards towards the last checkpoint, or roll off uphill sections of the track. In Payload Races, both teams race to deliver a bomb-cart to a final target; there are no checkpoints and unmanned carts will not move in reverse, but still require team members nearby to fully complete uphill sections. Both types of Payload maps can come in single-round or multiple-round maps. In standard payload, further rounds will only be played if BLU wins. In Payload Race, all rounds will be played regardless of which team wins, but the winner of previous rounds starts with their cart farther up the track.  -Arena is a team deathmatch mode, typically occurring smaller environments featuring a single control point. In each round, players do not respawn on death; a team wins the round by capturing the control point or eliminating all of the other team members.  -Medieval mode can be played on maps dedicated to this mode, or enabled for any other mode type. This mode forces players to use melee or similar medieval weapons.  -MvM - Mann vs. Machine - is a six player co-operative mode where the mercenaries are defending a structure against increasingly difficult waves of robots. Players have the ability to buy upgrades and improvements between rounds using in-game money earned during previous waves. A 'Mann Up' version is available by purchasing tickets with real money to participate in larger events on official servers with the opportunity to win unique cosmetic items after successfully completing a Tour of Duty.

205100,Dishonored,"Dishonoured is set in some steam-punk (except with 100% more whale oil) setting, where you play as Corvo the Ever-Hungry. Corvo is a special body guard where he is paid by the empress with food, eventually a tiny group of people get sick of this bs and decide to frame him with a pretty heinous crime. You escape . . . blah, blah, blah . . . then you get visited by some 'spooky' dude because he has never met someone with such endless hunger and you get cool powers and stuff. You set out to get some revenge, but most importantly steal some sweet as f*** food from everyone you meet. Forgot the plot. :^)  But seriously, Dishonoured is a awesome sealth game, where you get seriously disadvantaged when going homicidal except game ends quicker, which I like. The powers you gain from the 'spooky dude' give you some nice interactions with the environment and people. The map layout has multiple paths you could take, depending how much you prefer to soak in the scenery. Overall I would reconmend this game like how much I'm liking Dishonoured 2 trailer (which is a ton)      P.S. Forget the plot, just eat and everything will be alright. :^D",1,1

50300,Spec Ops: The Line,"While the action of Spec Ops isn't anything spectacular, it's solid enough to keep you playing to see the story through. And it's the storyline where this game really shines. It's refreshing to have to deal with genuine moral dilemmas and few games will leave you feeling seriously uncomfortable with the decisions you've made as this one. It's definitely not one for the kids.  Whereas the game encourages you to play multiple times, there's little reason to do so beyond the multiple endings which a strategic save file can net you in one sitting. And the major decision you have to make isn't really a decision at all as you're forced to do it, shattering the illusion of freedom.  Despite the gripes, it's worth playing at least once to experience a war game actually dealing with adult themes rather than the one man army game or the hyper realistic extremes the genre seems to gravitate towards. It won't last you long past the 6 hours or se needed to finish it but it'll stick in your head for a long time after. In terms of narrative it's unmatched at the moment and should be experienced.",1,0

Sadly, it's completely ordinary, shallow and stereotypical. Despite a couple of good jokes, the story is dull, short and actually wouldn't lose anything if birds were real people. As a player, you make a choice maybe once per 5-10 minutes, the rest of the time you just read, and one storyline fits into an hour of play. The interface is poor (however, the game is done in Unity), the music is annoying. I'm not even sure that Hatoful Boyfriend is worth something as a common dating sim, but if you look for something specific — definitely avoid this game.",-1,0

252950,Rocket League,"This game is extremely fun to play with or without friends. It has the most staggering experience progression I have ever seen.

You're able to predict where other players will hit it. You're able to coordinate with a team and adapt to either offensice or defensive.  It's extremely team-based... it's soccer after all! Pay attention to the ball's next destination and always anticipate a pass from a teammate. You'll meet people who are very good at the game, and you'll make great friends through it. Whether you play duels, doubles, standard, or anything else, you will have a blast alone or with buddies.  Get it! You have nothing to lose!

312840,Fahrenheit: Indigo Prophecy Remastered,"There aren't many games like this one for good reason, most gamers tend to lean more towards a more active gameplay factor when it comes to their experiences and QTE (quick time events) are generally frowned upon, virtually my only hang up with this game is the length of some of the QTE scenes in the game and the lack of checkpoints within them, as you can figure it gets incredibly tedious to replay the same QTE over and over from the beginning each time you screw up so it does become discouraging.  QTE events aside the story is a well crafted piece guaranteed to keep you guessing to the very end and with three different endings dependant on your choices through the game there is plenty of different paths to take, the characters not just relatable are well rounded and have their own agenda's and idiosyncrasies to which you will find yourself either loving or hating them.  The control scheme though simple can be maddening if you are slow on the draw or using a controller without analog sticks but here are always work arounds and as for problem solving you won't wonder why you aren't slamming your head against a wall in frustration as most problems provide the solution by use of handy comic book style picture slide assuming the timer doesn't run out first.  With music tracks supplied by Theory Of A Deadman among other well placed scores will bring the whole experience together and with bonus points earned by finding hidden and not so hidden floating cards you can use them to purchase extra content by the way of Making of videos, Mocap, art design and extra minigames, ingame music and other videos.  All in all for the price you pay you get a thrilling adventure through a bizarre setting of the occult and science fiction if you can withstand the monotony of grinding QTE'.",1,0

It takes you back to learning a game when you're a kid. When you first start you're terrible and the games are silly and you score on yourself, but there is a massively high skillcap (GO WATCH A MONTAGE). The most important thing IMO is how often Psyonix releases these dank updates where they really are listening to the correct issues from the players. The new map is really simple and doesnt bog down your machine. They're trying new ranked bracket ideas. They give you tons of free goodies to put on your car and a few cheap cars if you want to spend extra. This is really great and I'm glad they are being inovative and listening to our feedback, but none of this matters if you're building on a weak set of game mechanics. I've made it to the highest ranked division (other than top 100) on this game and I still feel like I have a lot to learn. Overall the most satisfying experience I've had in a game since I was a kid.",1,0

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Four hours (just of having the game launcher open, not including looking into fixes), have run every single 'fix' in Rockstar's FAQ, have gone off to multiple forums in search of fixes, still have not got more than five seconds into the opening sequence before crashing despite running a decently beefy machine.  Obviously this game is amazing, but I feel I must voice that FOR SEEMINGLY NO REASON and EVEN WITH THE GUIDANCE OF R* SUPPORT, I still haven't yet managed to reach the main menu. You should be able to run this game fine, and if you do you won't be disappointed, but this negative review is a statistic representitive of a glitchy experience that many are suffering through.  EDIT: I fixed my problem by reinstalling Windows. Windows 7 update KB302245 corrupts certain DirectX drivers that the game deems necessary, which is why this problem can go unnoticed for so long on computers by gamers that don't play triple A titles. If you can't uninstall or repair DirectX, you'll have to reinstall Windows.  Other than that, as promised, I changed my review to positive since I fixed the problem.",1,0

It also doesn’t take a lot of space for room scale, so if you’re like me and have a small play area, this game is perfect.

373420,Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition,"When I first started to play I thought it was great, just my cup of tea. However, you soon get stuck in a town following a really meandering and confusing story with little opportunity to do any combat. The voice acting is brilliant but it goes on and on and on until you end up skipping most of it. After all, its not a book, its a game. Graphics are beautiful but UI is a pain.   Its biggest fault is the difficulty curve which is a mess - some fights are too easy and others are a frustration fest.

Let me elaborate:  - AMBIENCE: While graphics don't really matter to determine weather a game is good or not, game design does. Repetitive scenes and missions make you feel like you're doing the exact same thing over and over again. If that was not enough, the music is not engaging at all, more like a 1 minute sample playing over and over again. - CONTROLS: How cool is this 'change character' thing? Well, if only it worked. You will find yourself in a mess of control scheme that, while unresponsive, manages to be confusing and repetitive. - RPG ELEMENTS: Heh? No... there are none.  - THE CHARACTERS: A regular warrior and a regular archer - not vampire, archer.  Do yourself a favor and skip this.

241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"Got done with intro and entered the Black Gate map near a graug, knowing nothing of their ferocity. Decided I'd try to sneak up on it and kill it. Hit it once, then got roflstomped into the ground :D  This game was quite challenging for me for about the first half, but in a good way. You have to learn how to control your engagements as well as unlock useful skills to increase your chances of survival. For example, I decided to attack a captain in a stronghold for his rune and because I wanted him dead. His subordinates called in reinforcements, which was ok. Then another captain showed up, attempting to cow me with unneccessary banter and joining in the fray. Then another came. And another. After about 20 minutes of flipping over Uruk backs trying not to die from this lovely gathering, one of my enemies finally vanquished me and gloated over it at our next engagement. He didn't gloat for long, though, as I made sure he wouldn't be able to breathe anymore.  A great immersion factor that this game delivers is captains remembering fighting you and how the last engagement ended. Not only that, but they bear new battle scars. I had one captain come back to try to kill me three times after I thought I left him for dead. Thinking that his reappearance had something to do with his head still being on his shoulders, I paid attention to how I 'killed' him the third time - Urfael (my sword) through the face. This guy was really annoying me with how he just wouldn't die, so I breathed a sigh of relief that I wouldn't have to deal with him anymore, seeing as how his brain would have a nice slice through it. He found me once more after that with his head wrapped in rags, to my dismay. Then I killed him dead dead.  It's also fun to sneak up on Uruks who are having a conversation, kill the listener without the speaker noticing, then cutting the speaker's next sentence short.  10/10",1,0
39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"As someone who is burnt out on tab-target combat and hotbars full of skills, I'd always written off FFXIV as more of the same and not worth bothering with. It's always scored highly by critics and players alike though, and is still one of the few MMO's able to command a subscription to play. So after a few steam sales I found myself in possession of the base game and the Heavensward expansion, and I thought I'd give it a try.   I can see why people like it so much; whilst the core game is dated, it's polished and well-produced, with reasonable graphics that will age well. Voice acting ranges from good to bearable, and the story (whilst suffering from a lack of interaction on my part beyond nodding and killing things) was enjoyable. I tanked lots of normal-mode and hard-mode dungeons, but not the really high-end stuff, and found that even though I exclusively used group-finder, everybody I met was either relaxed and helpful, or just silent. As someone who is shy of instances with random people because of bad experiences on other games, this was pleasantly surprising to the say the least.  Unfortunately as I closed in on the level cap of 60, my fatigue with the combat and hotbars bloated with skills caught up with me. FFXIV is a good game though, and if tab target combat with lots of abilities, dungeoneering and raiding are your thing, then you should check this out.",1,0

It may have a simple control system and gameplay style and not be the usual RPG with no turn based combat, but with what this game lacks in the traditional sense it makes up for it in heart and story. This is quite possibly one of the most beautiful and moving games I have ever played, I'm not afraid to say that I spent my hours playing this masterpiece with both a smile on my face and a tear in my eye. Freebird Games have made something beautiful and truly fullfilling, I cannot recommend this game enough, it's up there in the ranks of American Beauty and Sunshine of a Spotless Mind for media that will truly want you to make the most out of your life.

293840,Cult of the Wind,"I got this game for free from bundle star, and thank god I got this for free.  While writing this review, there are exactly FOUR (as in one, two, three and four) servers online. Two are empty. One has 1 person playing, with a ping of 9999, while the other has 14 people in it. Maybe because I am in Asia, but all the servers have pings over 200 (I'm using a 200Mbps connection), so it's really not possible for me to play without a certain amount of lag. That pretty much sets the scale of the community: so small it's pretty much a speck of dust in the gaming universe.  Alright, I joined the one with 14 players. So basically, you enter the server with the list of players on either teams, allies and axis (when is this game related to WW2? Ah whatever). You will need to click on 'player', where you will choose your skin and stuff, and then click 'spawn' to begin playing. This took me one whole minute to figure out. Come on, in which game is the spawn button so well hidden?  So, I began my adventure of pretending to be a plane in one of the four maps the game has to offer! Apparently I am some mummified female running around holding out my hands like some immature kid, running around and jumping (no we can't guide or whatever, we jump and land like how we do in normal third person shooters). There is only one game mode: capture the flag. Basically that is the responsibility of someone without a 200 ping, so I'll pass on that and run around chasing mummified players.   There are 4 sets of 'consumables' in your HUD screen. One is health, on the bottom right. The one below health is, i believe, 'oil'. You consume oil when you run, period. On your left are the weapon ammos, primary and secondary weapons. No sure what secondary weapon does, though the primary weapon is a machine gun which deals around 1 dammage per shot (not sure exactly, have to verify). I managed to deal 20 dammage on to an enemy after emptying my 100 bullets onto 'her'. Not very accurate when you are running around. Still, there is a catch: you cannot see your bullets. The only sign of you firing your 'gun' is that you're clenching your fists, or holding your hands out in a diving position for secondary firing. I can't decide whether I should cry or laugh when I saw this. Well, maybe I should use Oxford Dictionary's 2015 word of the year to describe how I feel: face with tears of joy.  You can replenish your 'consumables' by grabbing flags all around the map.   Oh and even though you are supposed to be a plane, you take heaps of fall dammages. I died after falling from some high place with more than 50 hp...   This is a normal third person shooter which the player pretends to be a plane but failed in doing so, in a miserable manner as well. There are many game mods which are free and have better game play and communities. Try it only, and if only, it is free. Other than that, do not get this under any circumstances.",-1,1

247240,Volgarr the Viking,"An expertly done homage to the old 80s arcade classic Rastan, with Ghouls n' Ghosts elements.  Volgarr the Viking is fun to play, and it controls pretty well.  But just like Jörmungandr can grasp his own tail in an endless loop, so too will you be trying to make progress in this game.  I believe our modern gaming age is trying to capitalize on what they like to call 'NES Hard'. In other words, a lot of people crushed their skulls in some sort of mechanical accident, and seem to remember every single classic game as being brutally difficult. I know for a fact, being 34 years old, that not every game was this way. There were quite a few games that offered health, lives, powerups, passwords, and continues to help you progress. Even when you barely made it through a tough boss fight, you still felt like you were progressing.  Volgarr the Viking is a well made game that doesn't capitalize on being cheap. All the enemies are static for the most part, so you can learn the patterns after a while. If you keep messing up, it's your fault. Just change the way you look at things, and you will progress. There are powerups to give you shields, an extra piece of armor, or even a flaming sword. You just have to get powerups(chests) consecutively to get the full set. First pickup is always a shield, unless you already have one. So if you lose your shield, your next powerup will be another shield to replace it. If you still have a shield when you get the next powerup, you get a better one, and a better spear. Keep that pattern going of not getting hit(easier said than done), and you get better and better stuff. Without this gear, you are literally one hit, one kill. Pretty flimsy for a Viking badass. :D  I enjoy this game quite a bit, even if it makes me cuss. Thank you to Thorlofanarson for the birthday gift!   10/10",1,0

274230,RONIN,"It's fun, but it gets a little bit too much at times. Controls can be very finicky, and your movement options often get restricted in weird ways (like not having a quick way of climbing over a ledge/corner). Your jump is also pretty off-and-on, although it's less life-damaging as the game auto-pauses for you to line up a jump.  The game seems to be going for the Hotline Miami brand of repeated slaughter broken up by swift deaths, but the game's loadtimes tend to break that trance. They're not long, but definitely long enough to make the infinite deaths a pain in the ♥♥♥. It's comparable to a death in, say, Dark Souls, but the thing with a dark souls death is that your subsequent life is going to last longer than the thirty seconds it will in Ronin. As such, it gets swiftly tiresome, especially on very difficult sections.  If you want to upgrade skills, you'll want to go for the perfect runs in each level: no alarms, all enemies dead, all civilians spared. It's basically required for the later levels, although one upgrade in particular makes one of the bosses a two-turn affair, so hopefully they fix that.   The game's soundtrack is fun, nothing amazing, nothing horrible, and a few tracks are real stand-outs. They contribute to the game's tone, which is good, because there's no dialogue beyond a few loading screen monologues.    It's a decent game for a ten dollar pricetag, and will probably last you around eight hours for a single run - perhaps double that for a full new game+ run. That said, I really didn't feel a desire to go on after I'd beaten the game. Still, didn't consider it a waste of time, and the game takes a prety cool approach to a binary ending - there are no red vs blue buttons, just a matter of skill and some pretty cool thematic mechanics.

It can be played via LAN in a room with a full Bridge setup, just like Artemis, to great effect. But it can also be played alone, online with friends, online with strangers via lobby, or any combination. No fiddling with self-constructed servers required. There are even different types of ships to accomodate different crew member numbers, for those occasions where you really want to simulate a bridge but it's just you and one other guy, certainly not an entire 'quintet'.

Many of these perks ranging from the melee centered Berzerker to the tactical art of being a Demolition specialist, they all have their own unique vibe. I can say Team work is of vital importance if you plan on playing on a difficulty other than beginner, a team needs to be well balanced, and the communication needs to be there for success. Tripwire Interactive provides the game community with many free holiday events. These events bring new maps, weapons,achievements and enemies for free. A definite buy!",1,0

234140,Mad Max,"I played this game from start to end. I played the whole story and did a decent amount of the free-roam objectives. I would like to recommend the game because it's a good game but.. I can't recommend it just *because* it's a good game, why pay 50€ for a good game when there are so many *great* games out there for less?  Here are some of my opinions about the game: * The story is kind of harsh, it was not what I expected from an seemingly common revenge plot. It fits the mad max universe well. * The upgrades are many, but customizations are very limited. Your car is everything, it's basicly maxs soul. So I found it surprising when there were so many upgrades but no customization. After all customizations are what makes your car yours. * Controlling the car was often challangeing and sometimes frustrating, the devs are not car fanatics that's for sure. You will find the controlls sloppy and a lot of wiered mechanics. For example, adding weight to the car creates a delay from stearing input and upgrading the suspension gives you more turning radius. Becuase this makes totally sense... right? * If you want all the upgrades be prepared to grind and grind and grind and grind... you get the idea.",-1,0

8870,BioShock Infinite,I really can see why this game was so polarizing upon release after my short amount of time with this game. I am going to go ot on a limb and say I have no problem with the combat like most people claim they did. Ken Levine and his team did a great job in creating a believable world whihc sucks you in as a player. This engroses you into the story which I actually found to be quite interesting no spolers that will be all I say. Graphicss wise its pretty sharp and run it one setting below ultra and it still runs and looks good. I would reccomend this to anyone who enjoys first person shooters that are different from your typical Call of Duty game.,1,0
345080,Flame Over,"Really really close to a very good game, but has several major issues that hampered enjoyment for me. There are some major glitches involving upgrades, which end up making the game way too hard. There is also no way to save a game and resume it later, which makes actually beating the game agonizingly time consuming. Every four stages you unlock a new stage to start at, however you start with the same basic equipment regardless of which stage you begin with. This makes starting at later stages strategically meaningless, but also makes actually beating the game agonizingly time consuming.   I had a good deal of fun with it, as the main gameplay ideas (fight fires, save people) are pretty fun as presented here. However the game seems to really get in the way of itself, and I found myself more frustrated with the limitations presented than enjoying the progression of the game.  Could easily be patched and improved, but developers seem to have abandoned it. Oh well. For now, half-hearted shrug of mild dissapointment. I guess I'll thumbs up cause it was a good 5 hours of fun.",1,0
20570,"Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II - Chaos Rising","Just another Warhammer 4k game, awesome gameplay but beware those who played DoW1.   1.This game unlike the previous where you basicly create a mass warfare. Its rely more own units and combat tactics unfortunately there is NO base-building and only a small army are allowed to have in the battlefield. This makes its infamous among old school DoW1 players such as me.  2.If you want to discover the trilogy of Warhammer 4k this game is nearly perfect. As example chaos army may chose their Dark Gods to worship and each faction has awesome build-in character from top to bottom. And the campaign included have the same storyline from DoW1 chronicles such as Eliphas, Davian Thule and Captain Angelos.   At first I was bored after catching up with the storyline its not bad and no regrets buying it",1,0

425210,Shadwen,"Different from the colorful and beautiful scenes of 'Ttrine', this game is based on a dark style. I would say it is a good game, and its a good trial for the company to swich the 2D game into 3D. I see some common features with the Assassin's Creed Series so it would be a piece of cake if you have played AC series a lot.  Funny moments:  The funny part of this game is that, sometimes you need to move the boxes to prevent enemy sights of seeing you. Well, if an enemy spotted you and see the 'Strange Position' of a box, he would investigate it and return after a short time. So if you go with non-killing route, you would probably need to create some Labryinth of boxes!  Something about the routes: ( YOU CAN IGONRE IT)    I dont want to talk too much about it, but I suggest a pure non-killing route first and all-killing the second. Non-killing route requires more time thinking while killing route is easier. Besides, each route has 2 endings. You can choose to kill/punish the king. The final decision will affact the ending the most.     Pros: One of the shining points of this game is the great idea of time flow design! You don't need to S/L wihile you died/change your strategy. It helps me greatly come up with better sneaking solutions.  Cons:    I feel the AIs are kind of stupid,,,(forgive me to say that and I just play with the normal difficulty). In this game, u can only give desitinations for Lily to go. If she was spotted while she was almost at the next cover( bush/grass), she would 'Go straight' and the enemies seemed to ignore her. I actually used this 'bug' to help me achieve non-killing record for the first time(non-killing route). When she was spotted or going to be spotted and was less than half way to the next cover, she would return back to previous one AUTOMATICALLY. I found this is kind of annoying and I always needed to flow back time and gave her more detailed instructions.     No skills needed and the segments and blueprints are useless. You can still use them if you want, but I just did not use them at all in both non-killing/killing routes. (I will talk about the 2 routes later) You just need to drag the boxes all the time to distract them and get Lily to the destination.  ",1,1

They have under 2 hours of game time and they are leaving a negative review because the killer is too 'op'. Yes i agree the killer is pretty strong right now but i have only actually died 4 times since the patch yesterday. Also, these people just got the game. Instead of learning how to play better they leave a negative review that feels more like a rant.  Into the review. Yes the game is pretty buggy. But the devs are awesome. There was 4 hot fixes in one day to address various bugs and matchmaking. Also the devs stream and let us know whats on their prioirty list and was being taken care of. This dev team is super vocal and i love it.  Pros - A fun challenge for both sides. - A great dev team. - A great game to play with friends. - The game doesn't feel repetitive. - Only $20.  Cons - Matchmaking was rough but its been getting better since the last patch. - They've been nerfing the survivors a lot lately but ive learned to adapt and still win games all the time. - Sometimes game changing bugs occur but will get fixed rather quickly.   TL;DR The game is great and i have a lot of fun playing it. Great dev team. If you are on the fence about getting this game i say get it. Plus its only $20.",1,0
457520,Moustache Mountain,"I love to support indie developers, and so I pick up a lot of their games. Moustache Mountain is an example of this, and I tried really hard to like it. I really did. But even at a low price, the flaws in this game far outweigh the positives.  Now, let me be fair up front and say that I'm not a big platformer guy. I know, that spells bias right there, but I can get on board if there are some interesting mechanics. And that's the problem here -- the mechanics are just boring. One can argue that this is intended to be an NES-throwback, retro experience, but I more get the feel that the game is being limited by either the developer's experience level or a game builder platform used to create it. In any case, while the levels are 'randomized' (they're not randomly generated, but merely picked at random from a pre-selected set), none of them are very interesting, and you beat the game if you get past level 15. I found a lot of the challenges to be cheaply frustrating, like having to jump around a ledge/overhang while you're trying to bounce up the wall. Maybe my lack of platforming prowess is what was holding me back, but I usually had to try 10-12 times to complete this manuever, only to die on some spike once I got past it, and then start over from the beginning of the level again.  The graphics are fairly dull, and the sound loop gets old in a heartbeat. Rather than practice this game to get good enough to beat it, I decided to move on to another more interesting title in my collection of 600+ (and let's face it, that means there are a lot I haven't played yet, so if a game doesn't get interesting fairly quickly, it's time to switch gears). I do plan leave it open over night to collect the trading cards, which I can at least use for leverage for other ones I'm trying to collect. So, kudos to the dev for at least creating achievements and trading cards. I just wish he'd invested as much time in the graphics, sound, and gameplay of this game.  At least I got this as part of a bundle, so I don't feel like I need to return it or anything. I'd encourage the dev to keep trying, but to spend a lot more time focusing on concepts and mechanics that will make the game interesting and differentiate it from the hundreds of others available on Steam. In the meantime, I can't recommend this one.",-1,1

Bugs with multi-level dashing (50/50 that your soldier will run in place you do not point).  I do not recommend this game, it lacks good UI, balance and your gameplay will heavily depends on random.

299260,Commando Jack,"  Received for free from an IndieGala giveaway.  Very simple tower defence. No story, decent graphics. Something best suited for mobile/tablet portable devices and best suited for many short bursts of gameplay (something to pass time while on the train/toilet, etc.).  You have to switch between regular tower placement mode and first person turret mode to do some damage yourself. There are some enemies that your towers won't be able to hit that you have to take care of in first person mode.  Later on there are elemental enemies that you'll want to use the correct elemental towers for.  Gold is pretty easy to come by and there are so many levels that I think you could get very close to unlocking all upgrades by clearing the 45-stage campaign on easy without grinding.  Other random thoughts:    There are in-game achievements but nowhere I could find to view them.   Worth a look if you're need to pass time and want a generic tower defense (though the simple first person mode gives a twist) with plenty of levels to play through. I don't think it's worth it at full price ($9.99) but maybe at mobile prices (~$1-3).",1,0

359550,Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six Siege,"I want to start with the absolute best element of this game - it's gameplay. When two balanced teams with decent latency duke it out, this game is really on another level. Every game has the potential to be truly different and thus it can really hold your attention, and on top of that, it is far more exciting and immersive than any multiplayer FPS you've played before. I'm going to recommend this, I just want to point out why people are seeing a mostly positive and not an overwhelmingly positive average so that hopefully they can make a more informed decision. I held off on this game for a long time because the reviews weren't totally glowing, and I regret that. The truth is it does have some problems. I'm seeing now how difficult it must be to test this game for bugs, and it has taken a long time for them to work away at it. Some of it is gone now, but beware, it's not all gone. On top of this, I have never come across a game which spends more time loading than this. I understand mostly why it must be that way, but it really cuts away from the fun you could be having. The matchmaking is pretty slow on top of that, so you're really just going to do a lot of waiting for not much playing. My final complaint is that the player base can be extremely toxic. I've never seen so many people just straight up throwing insults around and being rude when there's no need at all. People use chat more to be toxic than they do to communicate about the game, and suprisingly few people use voice chat when it's pretty essential to the game. I recommend this - just please come with a good attitude towards teamwork, a mic, and be prepared to wait around.",1,0

There are several melee weapons, and ranged weapons too. The graphics are outdated due its realease in 10 years ago, but you still get the dark feeling of the game, and the sountrack gives you an immersion in the world.

323470,DRAGON BALL XENOVERSE,"8/10  Overall, Xenoverse is a good game. Moving away from the style of their previous games (the Budokai series, Burst Limit, Infinite World), Dimps crossed the line from 2D-Fighter to a Tenkaichi/Raging Blast-esque 3D fighter. Despite this, it remains a completely unique experience - whilst it certainly appears to be inspired by Tenkaichi, it plays a lot different. The emphasis is shifted from extensive combo strings to simply chaining short combos together (at least, if you're not a Saiyan, but more on that later).  Character creation is a welcome addition to any DBZ game, and the level up system borrowed from RPGs lets you differentiate your fighter from those of other people by letting you use stat points gained each level however you deem fit. The races are for the most part well balanced, each with perks and cons, but this is only until the Saiyans gain access to their Super Saiyan transformations, which allows them to spam any super and ultimate attacks for free until the transformation ends. Expect to run into Super Saiyans firing off their ultimates many, many times.  The Mentor system is overall a good addition to the DBZ gaming franchise, letting you train under iconic characters from the show and gradually learn their techniques and eventually their ultimate attacks. Why is this such a good thing? Mentors and the Skills Shop are the only places you are guaranteed to find skills - yet the skills you can obtain from these two sources probably don't even amount to half the skills in the game.   Which brings me to my one gripe - to get the vast majority of skills available for you to collect, you have to grind through every single Parallel Quest multiple times. The expectation would be that if you meet certain requirements within the battle, the skill you desire would drop, and you'd retire from a hard day's work. This is not the case. The way it works is, meeting the requirements only gives you a chance of the skill dropping - not a guarantee. As a result you'll find yourself grinding for hours on end hoping to obtain any of the following: Super Vegeta, Super Vegeta 2, Ultra Fighting Bomber, Giant Storm, Kaioken X3, Kaioken X20, Maximum Charge, Spirit Sword, and even more.   This is, of course, ignoring the other items you must grind for, such as the Z-Sword...and Dragon Balls. However, these items (and, if you think about it, most skills) aren't really essential for success in the game, and for some this will be a minor problem.  Xenoverse, despite its tedious amounts of grinding ultimately gives a fresh new experience in its excellent new combat system. If you're a fan of the previous console-exclusive DBZ games, or you want a fighter with a radically different combat system, this game is for you.",1,1
266840,Age of Mythology: Extended Edition,"Don't buy this if you want to play with your friends. I havnt been able to at all. I only bought it to play multiplayer, but we only experience huge lag and very unstable games. Sometimes you can play with lag, sometimes it just gives you a sync error. It works fine in singleplayer - no problem there. We have open ports, nothing running in the background - nothing helps. Oh, and we are not the only ones. There are plenty of people with this problem, and it has not been adressed by any of the developers. Poor reboot of a great game.",-1,0

201810,Wolfenstein: The New Order,"Really awesome game, but get's a little repetetive after a while, when they just keep throwing a lot of nazi robots and high hp enemies at you just to keep you ocupied. Should have been a more progresive story rather than just a 10 minute prologue about how you turned into a vegetable for 14 years. Having actually played those 14 years and seen the progress of how the nazi's won the war would have been great. I don't often care too too much on stories in games, but this one really had a great story that they could have expanded much more than they actually did. Still, pretty good game, had some really good moments which really made me feel like i was the character I'm playing. For 60 euro.. meh, as i said couldnt have been much more, but if you want a shooter with a good story, go for it.  Overall i'll give it a 7/10",1,0

I'll start with the flaws to get them out of the way since they are few. My only real problem with this game is the boss fights. Everytime I arrive at a boss I allwas find myself scrambling around the level for leathal weapons to use against the boss. Since I played entirely stealth and non-lethal, and my augmentatiosn reflect that, I end up woefully illequiped to fight bosses. Luckly weapons are readily availble but I still have to juggle my inventory to fight the boss.  With that out of the way the rest of the game is very well put together. As I said before I played it almost entirely with steath and non-leathal combat. I really enjoyed the ammount of options you are given to get between areas of the levels, with more options opening up with the right augments. If you like stealth games and si-fi you'll love this game. As far as story goes, I won't attempt to review it, but I enjoyed it.",1,0

Listening to the wind whistling through the (seemingly) empty wasteland gave me one of the most unique experiences I've ever had conveyed to me through a videogame.   It also helps that it's actually a fantastic game too, one that will stay with me as one of my all time favourite RPGs of all time. Seriously, Buy this game.

I've seen a few reviews where people have said its 'unfair' and its 'not if your heroes die, but when'. But sadly, that's kind of the point of this game. The game even says that most heroes will dies. People expect this game to be less harsh than it says it is. ive played it in early access and how it is now and it is a great game, you have amazing story, voice acting, immersion and a really dark, atmospheric world in which it is set. The only drawback is apart from the wealth you get from dungeons, there isn't much of a reward for long play time. 9/10 would recommend.",1,1

As we tossed around ideas as to where it could be, my buddy absenty said 'Probably above us.'  This was when, lo and behold, the Tank comes crashing right in front of us, having fallen from the bridge above us. Panic insued, and a story was born.

On the one hand there are :  - excellent graphics (game from 2011 gives my new pc plenty of work) - cool apocalyptic world with bad gangs and good people trying to survive, kinda mad max - big map with big levels - diverse missions for main story but smaller side missions - cool weapons, my favorite was the sniper rifle - weapons have cool ammo, some make enemies explode :) - vehicles which are upgradable by winning races - car races - mini games - plenty of achievements - sexy women - much interaction with npc's  On the other hand:  - the finale was such a letdown, a cold shower, I was expecting a bit cutscene but got less than 1 minute ... - some mini games are so hard that I just didn't end them, like the ones with the knife or banjo ... - some achievements are very hard, getting all collector cards for one, I got 53 out of 54, thanks a lot now I have to restart this game ...

463270,Ghost 1.0,"This game was GREAT!!!! An infusion of fresh ideas into a classic genre of game.  Quick Facts: -I took 36 hours to complete, including finding 100% of secrets -I I was able to find ~75% of the secrets on my own, I used a guide for the rest. -While it lacks a bit of the polish that you might see on a higher budget game, it's still a solid experience and it presents some very clever game mechanics that I liked a lot -Plays like a faster, more combat-heavy Super Metroid -Fun and genuinely challenging, but not unbeatable. About 3 of the game's challenges were tough enough that I had to stop for the evening, and I beat each one fairly quickly when I came back to it. -Manages to have a great sense of humor that can make me laught but doesn't stop me from taking the story seriously. -The way your ammo can refill itself over time lets you feel free to use whichever guns you like best without feeling like you're 'wasting ammo.'  -A huge assortment of guns and gadgets to experiment with.   Cons: -Voice acting is mediocre; not great, but also not bad enough to really weaken the story -The game can get just a little repetitive, but that's only really if you're 'grinding' to try and buy all the weapons, which you totally don't have to do. -The keycard and levelup system weren't terribly inspired.     For those unfamiliar with the 'metroidvania' style of game, they usually consist of side scrolling action in an open world, where you will gradually collect various upgrades to your character like a double jump or missile launchers. These upgrades will not only help you in combat, but also allow you to reach new areas; a double jump might let you reach a previously inaccessible door or a missile launcher might remove a barricade. Instead of going level by level, you are dropped into a large map and you must explore it yourself. Searching carefully and finding creative ways to use your various powers will often yield new upgrades and useful treasures.",1,0

After reading 20 or so negative reviews, ALL of them were complaints about the pricing model. I am curiously to see how many of those complainers come crawling back as soon as there is ANY sort of steam sale. This game is solid. They know it. They just don't want to pay for it since they are so used to downloading/ripping their games off of the internet.     It is pricey sure, but 2k knows the kind of leverage they have with this game. No other game gives me this kind of a rush, and it's gorgeous. I do agree, it's tough getting friends to buy into the game because of the price tag though. But steam sales will come to save the day. Those of us willing to pay a premium will get the benefit of having that head start. I get the business model 2k, that's business. It's not profitable to make everyone happy always despite agreeing that you were a bit too aggressive with your DLC's. Shoot.... at least hold off announcing your damn DLC's until people buy into the base game. No one likes people who have their heads stuck up their arses. As i'm sure you will learn from this experience, you need to respect your customers, or they will crap all over you....(and your forums). It's like you didn't learn from Coca Cola when they released their new coke recipe.

346900,AdVenture Capitalist,"'Compound interest is the most dangerous force in the universe' Albert Einstein.  The premise of this game is really simple; click a button, make money. Then, once you've made enough, automate the process to make even more. Simple concept and even though I've only played just over an hour (at the time of writing) the game is captivating. There is literally nothing else to do other than make money, making it great to play when you're studying and need a break every few minutes.  Even if you play around with it for ten minutes before leaving it alone for years, you'll continue to make money making it easy to jump back in and restart - this is known as 'selling stocks and shares' and nets you some pretty nice bonuses in the form of investors to earn even more quicker. It's a fun little game and there's nothing better than just watching the numbers go up. It's got microtransactions, but the game doesn't shove them down your throat and it's entirely possibly to win without them.  I would recommend this to everyone at least to try; if you ever come back to it, at least you have more money to jump back into the game.

268050,The Evil Within,"I not only don't recommend this game, but I highly don't recommend it! This game alone may be the most overhyped experience in my life.  I couldn't wait to play this game, I was constantly moving and bought the game ahead of time so, when I finally settled down, I could put some hours into it. From what I saw of the game (which wasn't too much) I was pumped. It looked like the next evolution in the Resident Evil series with an actual survival aspect to the game. In fact, the first hour of the game was phenominal; save one part where I was running from an enemy in an interactive scripted sequence, did the same thing three times in a row, and still managed to die on my first two attempts while getting away on the third.  I really should've paid attention to that sequence though, it was warning me about this game. In fact, the whole game feels like a luck of the draw. Don't believe me? There's a stat you can level up in the game that will increase your chance of instantly killing your enemies with a headshot. That's right! You're skill doesn't matter in this game. You WILL be punished for lining up that perfect shot. Not that that's a bad thing, I like that each enemy feels like an obstacle, in fact, I LOVE that stealth kills are a thing in this game, it requires you to rely on more than just your (very limited) raw firepower to survive. But, when given the opportunity to gain the upperhand, I've restarted the same checkpoint numerous times because of the inconsistency of my weapons. If you get surrounded and you're already low on health, you can't sprint away and your guns do practically nothing to help you clear a path.  But I forgave the game for all of that, even for the misleading dialouge: *picks up a chainsaw* 'I'll hold on to this.' *IMMEDIATLEY uses it and throws it away* (some sort of permanent melee weapon that requires resources to use would've been nice as an ACTUAL last resort). And, like I said, the first hour of actual game is great. You really need to take you're time in this game and, as you uncover each new moment in the game, it can really make you feel for some pretty intense moment, whether they're scripted or not.  However, I drew the line at the first 'tackle this mission however you want' village. All the great ideas are there, but you're character is useless at doing anything. Weapons don't hit their mark... A LOT! Melee weapons break at one use and are weak, meaning you will be punching things... A LOT! Stealth is mandatory for proper survival, unless you are spotted by the enemy, which will happen... A LOT! Especially since most of the times I was caught was by a situation I was forced into, which then escalated into me dying quickly, and restarting back at a checkpoint I was at 15 minutes ago. Eventually... I raged and murdered the whole town as quickly and loudly as possible, taking me out of the game by turning my character into a 60's cartoon rendition of a fight cloud full of fists, axes and bullets. And yet, I still died a few times, mostly because I spent at least two of those deaths unloading an entire revolver chamber into two different zombies' heads. WHY ARE LUCKY HEADSHOTS A THING!??!? I need to feel rewarded for what I am doing right, not treated the same as if I were shooting enemies in the foot.  But I kept going, telling myself that the game was still worth it and that I was going to have more fun now that I'm out of the village. Then I was forced into a conflict that lead to the death of any hopes and dreams I had for this game. Invisible, fast moving enemies that can choose whether that are hit by your bullets and can take off a third of your health (or more) whenever they feel like it. It also doesn't help that they have radars built into their heads because they always know where you are, no matter how preposterous it is for them to be able to track you; my best record was three rooms with three separate sets of doors that they had to bash open, run ALLLLL the way back to the start, into a dark corner where I was hiding. Mind you, it took me three minutes to run to and hide there, and it took them practically three minutes to get through all three sets of doors, but they still knew where I was and could track me from over a mile away like they were right next to me.  For a split second, I thought I was playing a free to play game and almost reached for my wallet so I could jump over the ridiculous pay wall they set before me. Then I realized that this game has no pay wall. Your suffering is its payment. And I was not okay with that.  ♥♥♥♥ this game.",-1,1

32370,STAR WARS™: Knights of the Old Republic™,"The strengths of KOTOR are what I now play BioWare games for, which is the emphasis they put into writing. If I had to give my formula for what makes a good game it would be a well written story with finely tuned gameplay. With KOTOR the gameplay is decent, it’s your standard party based RPG where you can tune your character to suite your play style through various skills and feats and you can pick two members of your party to accompany you with their own skills so you conceivably conquer any obstacle. Knights of the Old Republic is probably the best Star Wars game that has been made and it can back up that statement with multiple awards and Aspyr Media porting it to Mac OS and iPad. Yes, you can play KOTOR on your iPad!  I could go on for several more paragraphs on the level of writing behind KOTOR but when good writing is basically BioWare’s identity now should they even get credit for doing what is expected of them? Instead let’s talk about something that has been slightly controversial in games: moral choice. A feature that has been popping up more and more recently, in games such as Dishonoured, Mass Effect, Infamous, The Walking Dead, et cetera. My biggest problem with the majority of moral choice systems in games is that the choices aren’t realistic enough or so obvious that you make choices to get the result you want instead of getting the result based off the choices you made. Often the choices are give an orphan a hug or murder said orphan’s cat and I realize that in 2003 and even today it probably wasn’t the easiest thing to do to make a program factor in several different choices like a choose-your-own-adventure novel. In KOTOR your moral choices are do you want to be a jedi or a sith?  Speaking of laser sword wielding samurai the whole RPG element of the game falls apart when you’re basing your game on a preexisting world meaning that the wealth of weapons, armor, and upgrades are going to go to waste since the majority of players are just going to be using lightsabers and wearing jedi robes. Sure there’s a certain amount of customization to be held there, you can use one lightsaber or two lightsabers be they normal or short or wield a Darth Maul double-ended job. Providing you have the right crystals you can change the colour of the blade and add augmentations. Of course you can always choose not to play as a jedi and go through the rigmarole of playing as the class you started out as or micromanage your party’s equipment like the weird mother who is just a little bit too involved with her children’s lives. The stats portion of all of the equipment I also find to be rather a large waste of time. Most people I know who have played KOTOR simply go into the swkotor.ini file type in EnableCheats=1 into the proper location and then in game hit the “~” key and enter the invincibility cheat.  Knights of the Old Republic is still a good game even for a Star Wars game or maybe in spite of being a Star Wars game. Of the Old Republic franchise it is my favourite and the fondness I feel towards it made me try other BioWare games with an open mind. Though playing through it this time I realized that Knights of the Old Republic can be considered a rather successful reimagining of Star Wars IV: A New Hope and in same degree the rest of the original trilogy. I think we can all agree that if you’re going to draw heavily from a Star Wars movie you might as well do it from the good ones. But seriously if you haven’t tried KOTOR yet I strongly urge that you do.",1,0

After a while sitting there thinking about nothing in particular it struck him. “What the hell am I doing with my life! This could be so much better!” He storms off to the hardware store comes back with a fresh buckets of paint. After hours upon hours of toil he sits back and admires his new beige wall.

Cons:  - Missions were so unbalanced. Some of them were extremely easy, some of them were so difficult. - The game itself is unbalanced! You can die in 2 or 3 seconds if you are under enemy attack. - You'll come to a point where you'll need a lot of money. Yes, you'll stuck for having small amount of money...  And also, %100 of this game is hard. Yep, this is really hard. This was harder than San Andreas for me.

24240,PAYDAY: The Heist,"Payday: The Heist........Great game overall and all round fun but let's get real about this.....I'm a robber who has earned millions already and now I'm robbing a bank.....Why can't I just get a decent drill to get the vault or whatever open. Sure it's part of the game but it get's to the point where you can't get decent drills.   Let's talk about the game and it's good parts. It's a fun game with friends esspecially the Diamond Heist Mission as you can do it all stealth mode and it's fast and easy and get's you a ton of cash. It maybe hard playing with other players online as there's a lack of communication but when you're playing with mates it's fun, suspenseful and rage inducing at times.    Overall, Payday: The Heist is a classic Cops Vs Robbers game where it's fast paced when you have to escape, suspenseful when you're going stealthy and the tension builds up as a ton of SWAT swarms around you when you're waiting for the drill to finish. 5 Star game with a few downsides but none the less it's an amazing game with friends to play. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for an action packed game with mates.  -ŁogiX™",1,0

The visuals are impressive, and there is a huge amount of character building that goes on in the house you visit. In the short time you spend with the game, you learn all about the main character's family. For a player who grew up in the 90s, this game will be particularly special. As a game developer, there's a lot here to enjoy. Personally, I really enjoyed my time with Gone Home.

369070,Slain: Back from Hell,"I love Metal I love Pixels I come from the 80s  Thus, Slain seemed like it would be right up my alley, and although I’m enjoying it so far, it does sometimes leave me a bit on the salty side  The Goods  Atmosphere and Graphics: This is the best pixel art I’ve seen in a long time. Imagine all your favourite Iron Maiden, Slayer and Death album covers having a massive orgy on your SNES after popping enough A class to down a wilder beast - its that bloomin’ good, but it has a really dirty and scratched style to it that only enhances the metal vibe. Plenty of boobies and plenty of blood! Great animations and lighting effects too  Controls: overall pretty tight and responsive. I love parrying and riposting  Sound effects: proper 80s and very crunchy  Gameplay: when the game is at its best, it is an absolute blast to play, a blast out of the 16 bit past with all its 2d gameplay glory, and makes you feel like a titanic bad ♥♥♥ when you land a parry on a boss  The annoyances  Cheapness: OMG this game ican be cheaper than an email scammer who has £3m inheritance for you and just needs your ALL bank details so they can send it along. It regularly spawns enemies right on top of you( enemies damage on touch) or lets baddies shoot you from off screen and all manner of below the belt play. Whereas something like Dark Souls of Hyper Light Drifter is difficult and challenging, Slain can be so cheap  Pacing: This game is at its best when it lets you keep a high pace, such as the wolf parts or the earlier levels. However, it often forces you to play the same room/section over and over again because you keep dying – the levels are actually quite small and it gets repetitive.  Music – I am an uber metal fan (1000 albums plus yo), and the music was what originally drew me to this game. However, while the music sounds sweone for the first 30 seconds (damn i love that raw guitar sound) it gets too repetitive, with the same simple riffs over and over again. I wasn’t expecting Borknargar, but I was expecting better than this (well at least this is better than cold lake eh Curt?). Actually I think I’ll put some Bork on in the background instead.  OVERALL  Lads n lassies, at the end of the day, this was well worth the £5 I paid for it. The art is astounding, I loved the 1980s boobs and demons vibe, and when the game is rollicking a long at a good pace it is brilliant, almost like a pre SOTN castlevania. However, while it does 80s action platformer, it doesn’t bring anything new to the table, and it can throw a lot of cheap shots at you.  Not one of my top picks this year, but definitely not a bad game all in all",1,0

'Bad things happen, and you have to find a way to contain the damage, a good way.' - Delilah ~ Firewatch  I am taking the advice you gave me, Campo Santo's writers. I don't think you will like the result.  What is a bad thing that could happen? Paying more than $5 for this game. What is a good way to contain the damage? Me warning all of you.  The mystery is compelling, until you find out. Then you regret being sucked in. No spoilers, but it is majorly anti-climatic. The 2 lead characters are interesting, until you find out that this follows the bad part of the TellTale formula. None of your choices matter in the slightest, for any meaningful plot/character development. Even worse, there is no real resolution that is worth mentioning.  Firewatch not only lacks all meaningful plot/character development, but ultimately lacks an interesting story. It is as if they thought what they were creating was going to be profound, or transcendent. If they would have spent their time writing something that was good, then it could have resulted in being profound, transcendent, or at the very least being worth the asking price.  Seriously, don't spend more than $5 on this game. It's too late for my refund, but I can stop you from making my mistake. This is the bad kind of walking simulator. It's nowhere near The Stanley Parable, The Beginner's Guide, The Wolf Among Us, or The Walking Dead.  You can tell that the programming was done by a hack from DoubleFine.

252950,Rocket League,"Consistent Inconsistencies  There's a particular reason im thumbing down Rocket League. This Football with Cars Type of game is beautifully executed, has a clear visual style, tight controls (although partially frustrating on double-jumps not adjusting when using ball-focused camera) and a huge following. So huge, it caused massive outages in its early days. Those are luckily a thing of the past and it's a great party game because of its built-in splitscreen.  While the game has a certain simplicity to it, the advanced moves such as aerial kicks, handbreak slides and precision shots can offer a huge skill ceiling.  And that's where the huge problem comes in. This game is consistently inconsistent. After you've hit a certain rank and skill level yourself, you will notice HUGE sways in game results based on sheer luck and ♥♥♥♥ery in the physics system. Even at 20 milliseconds of ping, you will regularly phase through the ball, hit it clearly but 'miss' it, while it does a twitching animation reminiscent of early access games and concede frustrating amounts of goals not because your opponents were the better players, but simply because the way momentum given to the ball especially in pressed situations is so utterly unreliable it makes you wish to avoid engaging in pressed balls alltogether (which believe me is not a great strategy because it leaves you very vulnerable to long-range shots).  It should be of positive mention that the developers have kept upgrading the game with additional visual content as well as new game-modes, although they're nothing special, just your run-of-the-mill modifiers you'd expect from an arcade racing game. A bunch of it is in DLC-form (total cost at this point 13,96€) including a rather dodgy Delorian from Back to the Future which may or may not grant you in-game advantages. I personally found my winrate increasing ~10% when using it and memorably losing more commonly against it, but that might just be down to too small sample size of only 180+ hours.  The competetive scene for this title has remained rather small and lost a lot of viewers very early on as a result of these issues. There are amazing montages of pro-players to be found on the web, but they obviously do not contain those moments when it shouldve been a goal/save, but wasnt. Unless you have the patience and nerves of steel to improve yourself to skill levels where you completely dominate your opponents, you will frequently lose to slightly weaker opponents simply because they had more of those 'twitchy' moments go in their favor. You can even see the pros adapt to this, as they favor long-range shots and a stationary goalkeeper just to keep the randomness of a closer approach on a smaller scale, and sorry, if the pros at your e-sport have to change their playstyle to adapt to how bad your physics work, in a physics based football game, you have failed.  So, if you're just looking for a casual party-game with inexperienced players tumbling around and scoring hilarious yet rather awkward goals, go for it. But if you'd want to actually explore the skill ceiling and compete with others in the ranked ladders, don't bother. You're more likely to make holes into your equipment in rage, than to beat the game's consistent inconsistencies.  February Update:  With the Season 2 Update to Rocket League, even more of my previously negatively mentioned inconsistencies have been intentionally added into the game. You may now experience matches, even in the ranked ladders, on non-default maps completely at random. Not only are some of these maps intentionally designed to enable inconsistencies (curved walls leading to vastly different deflection angles based on the height the ball hits them) but you may also play on that map completely at random, meaning if you are not accustomed to whatever map shape you're playing on, and the other team is, because they've been playing on that map-type for a match or more in a row, you'll have another layer of randomized advantage and disorientation. Also, the developers intentionally patched the feature to forfeit the match before kickoff, resulting in a canceled match at a reduced point less (to potentiall skip the aforementioned sand map) out of ranked queues, leaving you completely at the whim or RNG to be forced to play on a map you may not be accustomed to.  Additionally, matchmaking for the randomized player queues has been obscured, in that it no longer displays you any progression in your rank. You may find yourself de- or upranking after any match, based on your 'performance' (which is basically nothing else than your in-game score) meaning you now get additionally penalized for a defensive playstyle which tends to be a safer choice but yield lower scores than a risky all-out attack strategy. It also takes the ranks of the players you're matched with into account for the ranking changes you no longer get shown, so hurray for even more RNG. If this review would have a score, it wouldve gone down from a 7/10 to a 6/10 simply because of the developers unrelenting intent to patch more inconsistencies into the game.",-1,1

211400,Deadlight,"You know a game has problems when the 1st cutscene you see has no audio and you need to look for a solution online. Solving the problem involves replacing a .dll file which really says alot about how little pride the developers put into this game.  Such games requires good game control which this game doesn't have. Often resulting in frustating deaths. The control can be slaggish at times, other times it buffers key press during animation which results in unwanted movement control being executed.  Audio is inconsist in volume from cutscene to cutscene which can result in being too low or too loud. Granted the difference isn't big enough to spoil the game but its definitely noticeable. If having to adjust volume up/down is your thing, please go ahead and buy this game.  The game offers alittle less than 3 hours of gameplay + cutsecen. Given the price, its definitely not worth it. Even without all the flaws it have.",-1,0

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Now the game has reached its mid-life crisis, I thought it deserved a proper unbiased outlook.   Overall I still would recommend this game only because of it's play-ability and addition of the server browser. It's still to be seen but I think that since this game's physics was good, there still may be a population in the lobbies for at least 2 more years.   I overall enjoyed this game, though I admittedly played MP mostly. The campaign was cool, good story and cinematics. Zombies was cool though that's not really my bag. Most importantly (to me and a few others I imagine) the multiplayer was cool and I very much enjoyed the physics and game-play in either core or hc. Guns were balanced nice and black market is a cool added level of custom-ability. The movement system was to me an awesome evolution, while nice and fast, I did feel that the jumping was just a hair aggressive. (looking forward to IW as it seems a tad watered down which is nice)   The DLCs were good though I felt sorta let down by the season pass. I think if they added a season pass lobby, that would have solved 90% matchmaking issues and boosted lobby population.  It sucked that there was no Arena players on PC as I really want competitive COD to make a resurgence in IW. (I'm out there, u can friend me to get pwned lol)  Definitely a classic COD IMHO.",1,0

Kinda sad to hear everyone else is having so much trouble. Hope the issues are solved soon and everyone gets to enjoy the game as much as I currently am.

From the graphic aspect, the background is awesome, the pixel art is good, but the choose of the red it was too vibrant and saturated, for a dark game, it shines too much.  From the gamedesign, all levels are very well crafted, with very specific timming on each place. The jump is interesting, easy to learn, hard to master.

65980,Sid Meier's Civilization: Beyond Earth,"Worth waiting for!   A highly anticipated game but doesn't seem to be entirely finished yet. Guess it will be updated with several minor fixes soon, but as it is, it's lacking some of the features from the old Civ and are a bit rough around the edges.   For example:  - Some of the dialogues are outside their boxes  - Missing speech or very repetitive from several of the leaders. - The leaders seems to be suffering from dementia (keeps regurgitating about certain old things even when the issues are solved a long time ago)  - Victory (lose) screen is a mess and you never know why you won or lose if you don't take the 'one more turn please'-route. - Puny diversity when a military unit advance in combat experience. Every unit gets to chose from the same two options (heal 50hp or to gain in attacking power) all the time. Feels boring and seems to be a quick way from the producers to avoid making the game unbalanced but to be released in time.  - No way to tell what a city just recently produced as this important info isn't available as before.   The above is just some of the minor annoyances in the game now. Hopefully they will be fixed soon.   Of course they will be charging for more leaders and more maps later on; so it's not worth complaing about that. A complete edition of Civ - Beyond Earth will probably be in excess of 150 Euro if you buy all expansions and DLC's when they are recently released - as always nowadays. :)",1,0
270880,American Truck Simulator,"I have just started the game, but I want to add my insight.   First off, I love this game. I am a huge Euro Truck fan and I am glad that SCS finally brought trucking to the United States. Reminds me of the good ole days from 18 WOS. I know it is only a starter, but this should be an Early Access than a full game.  Pros - Beautiful graphics.  - Fun/addictive. - Love the cities.  - Police Cars   Cons - Only two states. (I know they are adding more as the game progress. Can't wait until New York is added, to truck across the country, which could take god knows how long.) The lack of states make me feel and know that the game is incomplete. Some signs say closed, but I know once they add expansions they will open. I know when they add more cities, those routes will be opened.  - Only two trucks. One Kenworth and Peterbilt. (They are adding more soon, when they do I will take this line off) - Fines. $1000 fines for speeding is much. I was worried about fines in Euro truck, now it is high. I had $1700 at the start, and a speeding ticket and I accidentally crossed the stop line, left me with only $53.   Overall great game. As time progresses, this game is improving, especially with the small staff at SCS. Kudos guys. Some persons are mad because this is the same as Euro truck. The President of SCS said this in an interview already that the two games will be similar. Same tasks, game mechanics but different location. And of course the cities are going to be small and not exact to par like in the real world. It is a $20 game. And this is a game, not real world. I am certain that the game will change some of the things. over time. But that is it, OVER TIME. I love the game as is, but if you want more content, I would wait. SCS is really working hard and remember they are not a huge corporation, so they work at a slower pace. The states themselves are small, but thats what happens when we have to drive across statelines for a delivery. What were you expecting a real 5 hour drive from LA to Las Vegas?   8/10 - Great game that will improve over time. Can't wait for Arizona and the upcoming states and trucks.",1,0

Guiding you throughout a dream-scape, parkour-puzzle sort of world is a series of colourful and dynamic scenes and puzzles that change the world around you as it unravels its truth. A calm, soothing, often upbeat and cheerful soundtrack rassures you venture deeper into the world. The story of the game is quite short and took you on a slow but increasinly intense journey which really didn't make much sense on the first playthrough, small cutscenes didn't give away much about the story in the gameplay, but then the pieces all rapidly come together to reveal the dark truth which created a much different perspective on the second playthrough.   You gain attachment to the main character who I believe is Yo, as you explore the urban maze through a childs eyes, and how the smallest things look different to a childlike imagination. The puzzles are not to difficult and the controls are easy to pick up.  Recommend if you like puzzles, mystery, intrigueing storyline and beautiful imagery.",1,0

294860,Valkyria Chronicles™,"The most underrated gem on the PS3, Valkyria Chronicles is an strategy RPG darling. The game is unique in visual style as well as its strategy gameplay. But I'm not one to give a game credit solely for being a special snowflake. The game also needs to have excellent design and story. Fortunately Valkyria has that in spades. There's a lot of nuance and depth to the strategy that is simple to pick up but you've never really mastered. Each of the dozens of different and engaging levels can be approached in an almost infinite number of ways. The game also masterfully uses permadeath, by making it so that while the characters are likable, the length and difficulty of the levels makes it so that many times weighing your success against the personal sacrifice of your troops is not an easy choice. But most of all is how wonderfully told the story elements around our main cast is told. No game has made me cry as consistently as this one. Spectacular twists, lovable characters the game has it all. I cannot recommend it highly enough.",1,0

Also it has Steam achievements and cards for a great low price considering it's a collector's edition.   * Keep in mind people that most if not all the HOG's on Steam are not new (they are only new to Steam). This one is from 2014 originally. If you ever have any doubts before buying a HOG on Steam reference Big Fish where most of these games originate. The reviews for this one go back to 2014.

230230,Divinity: Original Sin (Classic),"My background:   - I adore the CRPG genre, citing BG:II as my #1 game of all time. However, I'm not writing this review to compare D:OS against BG:II or any other CRPG.  - I have only finished a single complete playthrough of D:OS, and that was on Hard difficulty. I restarted on normal probably 4 times until I created a group that I found I enjoyed, then restarted after that as 20 hours in the fights became trivial. - I'm typically a completionist. - I don't look at online guides (I'm sure if I did, some of my problems with crafting would be alleviated) - 194 hours logged at the time of writing this review. But probably 60 or so of those were AFK - so credibly 130 or so played.  I'll put my TL:DR right here: 4/5. Play it for enjoyable combat, interesting character interactions, and a decent story. Don't bog yourself down in crafting (though blacksmithing is worth it), or expect much in terms of cool loot / character progression past the mid-game.  That said, let's jump in.  Pros - The primary strength of D:OS lies in its combat system. This is turn-based at its best - each character's turn is powered by action points, which can either be spent between movement / actions or saved for the next turn (hopefully to make a big play).  - I've seen many reviews state that the story is generic and bland. While it wasn't a 10/10 experience for me, I did enjoy it. I thought the comic book style narration (I'm referring to the cutscenes - comic book is probably not the right description, but it's the best I've got right now) was well done and gave the story depth. Although the source material they were riffing on became pretty clear - particularly towards the end - it didn't detract from the overall experience.  - The conversation dynamic. I really enjoyed the rock/paper/scissors influence options that are available. I found it a refreshing take on how charisma works in character interactions. - Real choices about how to spend skill points: Upon levelling in many games - where you dump stats is all too obvious. There is a right choice and a wrong choice. That isn't completely untrue in D:OS - a Man-In-Arms character (i.e. Warrior) is going to want high strength, a mage will stay will high intelligence, ranger/rogue will want high dexterity, etc. But you are also forced to balance Speed, Perception, and Constitution as they all have major/minor implications towards how action points work for your character during combat. - The difficulty: Normal became too trivial too quickly, however, I enjoyed playing on Hard. I do think the game would benefit from having another difficulty level above hard (perhaps with more enemies per fight, rather than just making each enemy stronger). That said, it is not the cakewalk that many games are today, and it does a good job at presenting a decent challenge.  Cons - The crafting system was not my cup of tea. You receive a deluge of crafting items in the game, and then through a combination of experimentation / recipes you find in books, you are expected to figure out what items can be successfully combined in order to successfully 'craft' (similar to GW2 cooking). Few of the items you could craft warrant the tedium necessary to discover the recipe.  - High level skills are extremely underwhelming. Reaching the end of the road of character development I hope to gain my ultimate, flashiest powers. While the level 18+ skills are flashy, I rarely found them helpful or effective. Some character classes don't even have high level skills. - It takes a few hours to really be able to dive into the combat in the game (which is a shame - as I find that is the game's primary strength). After a tutorial dungeon and a few quick encounters, it is nearly mandatory that you run around the primary town of Cysael completing non-combat quests in order to gain the levels necessary to compete against the next level of monsters. - Lack of options for interesting companions. I only encountered two NPC's which I had the option to recruit during the entire game. You can hire henchman, but they have no personality / anything interesting to say. - Randomized loot: I feel like randomized loot isn't something that fits well with this game. Disregarding the bugs (end-dungeon chests dropping lvl 1 loot for example), it still just seems like a bad choice. One of the things I like most about RPG's is gearing up, comparing stats, mix-maxing, etc. However, the majority of the loot in this game is, well, garbage. It is pretty rare to find gear upgrades. You will likely find some cool uniques/rares along the way (at least I did), but don't expect this game to give you much excitement in the way of rewards. - Many of the puzzles in the game are tedious and fiddly - requiring you to carefully scan the room for tiny switches or light arbitrary torches.   Thanks to Larian for the effort they put into making this game. I really did enjoy my time with it and wish them the best in their future efforts.",1,0

Stutters like hell, frame rate dips below 30 constantly, a very ♥♥♥♥♥♥ port. Perhaps it's at it's smoothest when you're just fighting a group of goons. That's the only time it's actually smooth. First time you call the batmobile in, in freezes for a solid 15 seconds, then the frame rate is probably at like 3 fps, then it speeds up to a very stuttery 30. Disgusting port. One of the worst I've tried playing.  But the game itself is a fantastic game. Presentation is top notch, graphics by themselves are among the best, save for hideous texture pop in and sometimes a failure to even load a goon's textures. Dialogue is exceptional, although it seems a little more forced than usual.  Missions are very very fun, all of them very unique. It's a very dark batman.  Once it's patched, I give it a 9 For now, it's a game that is carried through the mud of it's poor performance by it's incredible everything else. 6.  FANTASTIC GAME POOR PRODUCT",1,0
203290,America's Army: Proving Grounds,"It's like a simplified version of Americas Army 3. Feels like a mix of CoD and BF but you actually have to think about what you're doing, and if you ♥♥♥♥ up you got a bunch of 30/40 year old army veterans on voice chat telling you how much of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ piece of ♥♥♥♥ you are, lol. 10/10 would get told off by an army veteran again",1,0
400,Portal,"Once you start thinking with portals, you won't stop. This game was a triumph. Portal is one of those games that you HAVE to play, or at least have tried to since some people can't handle puzzles very well. I could go straight ahead and give it a 10/10 but that would not do it justice. Within this beautiful Aperture Science facility, the player will face mind-and-space-twisting puzzles, lovely Companion cubes, GLAdOS completely awesome monologue, the most charming Turrets, an assortment of hazards and of course, the marvelous Portal gun. With pretty graphics that deliver what they should, a fantastic and immersive gameplay, unforgettable characters and gags, a Tasty Lie, and lots more, Portal is surely a game that deserves your attention, so stop wasting time, there is research to be done. I'll also make a note here: HUGE SUCCESS",1,0

262410,World of Guns: Gun Disassembly,"Personally, I didn't enjoy this game. Rather, it was more of a pain to play than fun. When I disassembled the AK-47 and M1911, they were so cool and very introcate. I enjoyed that bit, but then they introduced this EXP system where I had to earn EXP by doing more ♥♥♥♥ with the guns I've already destroyed. Then on top of that, there's literally banners featuring their DLC for this game. At first, I thought I'd give this EXP system a go, but then it instantly backfired on me because the tutorial was forcing me to do 'games' with said AK-47 where I'd have to COMPLETELY disassemble the ENTIRE weapon as fast as I could with no hints. Must I remind you that this was litearlly no more than 30 minutes of gameplay before they instantly expected me to remember how to completely disassemble the weapon and do it as fast as possible. This was just a nightmare for me because they added in EVEN MORE PARTS TO DISASSEMBLE, WHICH MADE ME EVEN MORE CONFUSED. Oh, and did I mention that the AK-47 is a ♥♥♥♥♥ to disassemble? If it were with the pistol, I would have been A LOT more comfortable, but no, they just HAD to stick me with the hardest weapon in the game to disassemble.  Look, if you're a guns expert and are too poor to buy real games on Steam, then this is the PERFECT game for you. If you're a casual gamer who knows a FEW things about guns, then no, go away, you're going to have a ♥♥♥♥ing brain injury before you're done finishing this game. Maybe it's because I'm impatient, but I'd rather have every single weapon there and already unlocked so that I could just shoot them, disassemble them, play with them on the fly instead of going through their 10 hour long tutorial and having to waste even more time on the exact same weapons that I've already got done with just to unlock more weapons.",-1,0

284810,Nightmares from the Deep 3: Davy Jones,"I had a coupon for this so figured I'd give it a go even though I'm not too keen on hidden object games... and I never played any of the other games in the series (turns out that doesnt matter, they are unrelated series). I was pleasently surprised by the game, and played the entire main game and then the bonus one in a little over 7 hours...straight. It is quite addictive, and this game gives the hidden objects genre a breath of fresh air. It's rich in plot, mystery, and intrigue.   Okay, honestly at first... the narration... I was pretty convinced I had just bought a game for 7 year olds. I turned my volume down and continued onward. It tells you in the beginning to turn the sound up for a better gameplay experience and maybe it's just me, but I felt better just reading the captions.  I played it through the entire time on the middle (advanced/intermediate?) setting, but there is the option for expert which offers it's own acheivement and does make the game harder with click penalities and turning off visual clues, etc. There is also a easy mode if you have kids or you are really really lazy.   There's the obligatory stereotypical find the hidden objects, but multiple types: the empty silhouette (figure out what object you must find from the shape), the list of words and then there is the interactive which is quite neat ( Here's a non-spoiler fake example: say you need a hot cup of water, you would need to find a cup, a heat source, and water and combine them to acheive the result.) These puzzles also help you by giving you a useful item you may need on your quest. Also, strange but nice, is the option to play a round of mahjong instead of the hidden object search. (I think there's also an achievement for playing 3 rounds of mahjong.) It may sound weird, but it comes in handy when your raging for the last thing on your list and don't want to use a hint or skip the puzzle (which are also achievements).  There are also tons of puzzles that involve logic skills and can take some time. Also, I found it quite interesting that you can travel between parts of the map freely once youve discovered them, and often need to go back and forth to complete objectives. That aspect really sets it apart and truly makes more of a point and click adventure first, hidden puzzle game second.   Bottom line: worth 10 bucks? Probably not. Grab it with a coupon or when it's on sale, it's a great time killer and was unexpectedly fun. I'll buy more from the series when they're cheaper. It's 7 hours of my life I won't get back, but sometimes that's better than just watching TV, and it's totally worth a thumbs up.",1,0

265550,Dead Rising 3,"So the PC port has it's issues, probably the same amount issues I have with my social anxiety. The capped 30FPS is a problem, but you can fix that, so that's not so bad. And they've seem to fix most of the problems after 2 years. Game hasn't crashed once for me. Framerates differ in different areas.  For a Dead Rising game, the free roaming aspect is my favorite, no load times in between areas, lots of different stores to go into much like DR1 and DR2. The main character, Nick, is a chumpy chump in the beginning, but he becomes a lot more fearless as you progress through the game, mostly due to the fact he's aching to get laid. And why wouldn't you become fearless for that reason, right? Kill a few thousand zombies here, so you can score some poon for your achievement.  The crafting system is better, you can make weapons on the go with some duct tape and Elmer's glue compared to DR2 where you have to find a workbench each time.  Saving the Survivors is about the same, but their wonky AI is still a problem, just don't bring them along as companions. They just weigh you down in your quest to get laid. Their constant complaining when you sprint too far away and the fact they need to be healed every few minutes because they didn't take Zombie Defense classes.  Psychopaths are all made after the seven deadly sins, pride, covetousness, lust, anger, gluttony, envy, and sloth. The Pride fight being my favorite because it's the only fight that has a heavy metal song. Was never big fan of the electrionic music that was introduced in DR2. I want to fight the mentally ill to edgy thrashy guitar goodness.  All in all, I would recommend it if you can get over some issues the PC port has. Free roam zombie slaying for your quest to claim your manhood.",1,0

284950,Pixel Puzzles: Japan,"I love doing jigsaw puzzles but I never thought to see if there were any digital versions on Steam. I found this during a Humble Bundle sale and thought I might as well try it for less than $2. It certainly hasn't made me want to throw out all my real jigsaw puzzles, but for what I paid for it, it's a fun distraction.  Pros: -I like the music and sound of the game. It's very minimalist and zen, very traditionally Japanese. It's nicely relaxing for a game like this. -The images are all Japan related, so if you like that kind of thing, you'll like these. -The 'level up' aspect is sort of neat, levelling up your little monk to do harder and harder puzzles.  Cons: -The puzzle pieces floating around in the koi pond is kind of annoying. It makes it hard to see what you have left or to spot corner and edge pieces without. Plus picking up a piece and dropping it drops it in a specified location where that piece 'spawns', not where you dropped it. -Pieces can't be put together on their own, they have to be dropped into their space on the board. So you can't put together a section separately and then move it into the main board when you can. This also means that just moving a piece onto the board to help find its space can sometimes accidentally have you drop it right onto its spot without meaning to where it snaps in, which spoils it a little bit. -The pieces are all always right side up. You don't have to rotate them or anything like that. -The pieces aren't 'standard' puzzle shapes, they're all strange little curves and blobs.  The game's certainly not bad, but I wouldn't recommend paying full price for it. And if you're a jigsaw puzzle 'snob' like I sort of am then the experience is pretty different. But for a cheap price and an hour or so of relaxing with a warm drink, this is perfectly fine.",1,0

It's a fun game for anyone who likes space exploration / building / combat, micromanaging (somewhat, there's always the auto button for skipping that part of the game...), and building their own ships. If you have played any of the earlier Civilization games (up through ~3), you know how to get a ship built fast and how important the details for your cities, er planets are for getting things done.

433100,The Town of Light,"It took me a little while to decide if I actually recommend this game or not, and I have decided on a firm 'no' for this one. Now, I am certainly intrigued by this style of serious games, and I knew to expect that, but this one just didn't impress me.   Pros:  - The story is certainly somewhat interesting (at least as you get started) as well as emotional/sad, and the potrayal of how the mentally ill were treated back in old times seems to be pretty accurate. And it's terrifying to imagine what it would be like, but this is exactly what that story does. I won't spoil anything, but from what I understand of medical history, this is exactly the type of horror that went down in these kinds of nightmareish facilities back in the day.  - The game itself is not scary like a typical horror game, but the concepts dealt with in the game are indeed terrifying (old timey 'medical' practices, ♥♥♥♥, treatment of mentally ill). - The graphics are not bad, and there is a fair amount of detail (pictures on the walls to examine, creepy old 'medical' devices).   Cons:  - Took me 4 hours to beat this game. I am typically a comletioist and love to explore absolutely everything (I can't say I had the same level of motivation as I do most games though). So even while on sale, I felt like I paid way too much for it.  - There is absolutely no skill or thinking necessary to complete this game. And I'm not trying to say it's too easy. There's literally none involved. It's not that kind of game. See the next point below:  - One of the very few things that you actually get to do in this game is explore the creepy hospital, yet it's not even much of an open world. Doors are locked until it's time to go to those places (no, you don't find keys and use them, they just open when it's time), and on top of that, you don't even have to figure anything out for yourself. The narrator tells you where to go each time. What's the point? I could just watch a short movie. Not even a movie that makes you think either, but one with Captain Exposition jumping in every few minutes to make sure you didn't have to think too hard.  - Sort of addressed above, but while you can 'interact' with and examine many objects, you don't actually do anything with them (except in a couple specific cases). You don't use them to solve puzzles, get into new locations, etc. Yet the game still has you do pointless stuff like take this random object over to the other room so that the story can advance.  - The game made me motion sick at some point (you walk sooooo slowly, but you can still move your head around at a normal speed).  - The voice acting (at least for English) is absolutely dreadful. The overenunciation (in particular, with 't') drove me crazy. I can still almost hear it... ugh.  -As far as I understand there are *not* multiple endings. A *few* times during the game, you can pick little dialogue options to say to yourself throughout the game, but I don't think it changes much of anything.   Final thoughts:  - It's a different kind of game, and a different kind of horror. There's no action/fighting, no puzzles, nothing to run or hide from, you just go where the narrator tells you go (and sort of explore along the way), and then the narrator and some images tell you a story. That's it. There's nothing else. Now, I personally think that they do a good job with the story itself, but it's just not enough. It's like part of a game that was never finished. There doesn't need to be a 3d, first person game to tell this story. It should have just been a short movie, or a novela. Feels like wasted resources. - Since this is a serious game, I'm not sure what the point is for this particular one... I think by now we all know that the mentally ill were abused and mistreated decades ago and that old medical practices were not only barbaric, but just plain stupid and wrong. So, is this game made to educate? Just to be scary/depressing? Not sure, but maybe it's not important.",-1,0

It miffs me when I get power-ups and the game gets harder with it. I work for a living but I'll be darned if I'm working playing a video game. With this game is Easy and Hard and even on Easy I want to dial it back even one more... I don't know... call it lame skill level. When I get a power-up I want things to die faster, not me watching my heat gauge even closer because you are defenseless once you overheat and very likely quickly die because you 'upgrades' cause you to overheat twice as fast but don't seem to give you twice the firepower. I was finding it easier just to upgrade my basic gun than to upgrade to a more powerful version. Sometimes I do like a challenge but not the one this one was giving me. Maybe it's just my personal tastes and maybe others will like this alot more than I but simply I just don't enjoy this game... on that note of course I wont recommend this.",-1,0

337000,Deus Ex: Mankind Divided™," VERY MIXED INDEED! :/   *contains heavy SPOILERS*  First of all I'm a huge fan of Deus Ex Universe and was waiting for this game with *heavy breathing* expression. When it was delayed by six months I had to pull my pants up and don't let my hype implode. So now, I've played it through on hardest difficulity and I have such a mixed reaction that I feel kinda obliged to write a review for others and devs.  This game has everything HR didn't have, but loses for not having a single thing HR actually had right. The game feels like a filler between part 1 and 3, as if it was created only to build up the hype and earn as much money as possible for the next release or DLC. (The microtransaction drama). The feeling of creepy story, immersive narrative and engaging character leveling and customization vanished really fast after the first hours in Prague, hell, even after Dubai. It's all very cleverly covered with brilliant level design, graphics and huge customization options, but if one sees it through, there is not much left in this game, which overall, makes me very sad, and thouroughly disappointed.    THE GOOD:",-1,1
259620,3079 -- Block Action RPG,"My favorite in the series.  As much as I love 3089 and 5089, nothing quite captures the surrealist atmosphere and intricate cities like 3079. When I first played 3079, I was dropped straight into a dystopian Scifi world, literally! You fall from the sky and get attacked by demons who have taken over the heavens! You can either die and wake up inside someone's house nursed to health (which is what happened to me) or you can evade the demonic forces and use your wits and your jetpack to land safely on the ground, while the face of the world is being altered by constant faction warfare. Call me nostalgic, but 3089 and 5089 just don't capture the same vibe for me, and as much as I enjoy 3089 and 5089, they are very 'Arcade' in comparison to 3079, which has cities that light up at night, giants that patrol the streets, with giant walls preventing anything from getting in or out, which of course you overcome with your trusty grappling hook.  3079 also features bases in the sky you can raid and take control of, and you can also change faction relations depending on who you are attacking! Want to switch sides? Shoot humanoid Humoids and start working for the arachnid Neanders.  Bases are distincted by the colors used on specific lights, which gets the job done, but a lot more could have been done. Buildings overall have much more interesting layout than in 3089 or 5089 which are based more around outdoor combat with hoverboards and attack ships. While there are Attack Ships in 3079, the controls are not as polished as in 3089 or 5089 from what I've experienced, though I don't fly much, because I usually crash.  While the visuals for 3079 aren't much to look at, they really drive home the rather alienating and surreal atmosphere, and the voxel-based environments allow for destructible environments and terrain, akin to Minecraft and the like. I have yet to blow holes in buildings, but I've certainly dug a few holes with high-powered explosives, something I have not done in 3089 or 5089.  This game is best described as 'Minecraft meets Stalker in a galaxy far far away', but that might be stretching it a bit.",1,0

238090,Sniper Elite 3,"This game is awesome, me being a really fan of sniping, loves this. And the best part of hit has to be the slow-mo, x-ray kills, I simply love them.

287920,Mortal Online,"I am actually enjoying this game but I don't understand why monster/animal animations are so bad, they do not match the hit, feels like it's laggy or bugged, some people told me it's been like that for 4 years+ and it doesn't look like it's going to get fixed.   Don't get me wrong, I love combat system, it requires skill and timing, punishes you for trying to spam attacks or not blocking properly, but honestly when it comes to kill monsters most of them have animations that don't match the hits, you get hit and then the attack animation shows up, or the opposite, you see the animation is coming so you try to block and you get hit right after.  Everything else looks great tho, exploring is amazing, the game actually looks good (do not trust youtube videos, it looks better than that), skill system is amazing, crafting is great.   PS: If you are new to the game (like me) play safe in Tindrem, level some skills, earn some money and read some books, make friends in there, try to join a guild and then leave that city, it is full of griefers and most people quit the game because they don't know where else to go.",-1,1

Outfits and Car Customizations look really cool, and the game is moddable. This game series destroyed GTA for me, it is just way more fun.

257850,Hyper Light Drifter,"Pros: -Amazing pixel art -Simple but challenging combat -Enjoyable exploration -Each fight is slightly different, keeping it from getting repetative -Dark Souls-esc bosses  Cons: -Counter-intuitive controls (Can take some getting used to.) -Art is nice, but sometimes makes it difficult to tell what is a barrier and what is a platform. -Very difficult (Don't buy if you can't stand dying constantly. Some strategy is necessary.) -Slightly clunky feel to movement and combat.  Very good game. It makes you feel *weak* when you play it, in a way I never really felt in any other games. The way you are so small compared to everything else, even friendly NPCs, and how enemies can simply power through your attacks without seeming to care, especially the bosses. You spend the entire fight dodging their attacks, only to be sent flying as soon as you try to attack, when they simply swat you away like an annoying bug. Not to mention the fact that you have to take a minute to cough up blood every once in a while. Your health bar is small, only lasting at most 5 hits, and does not regenerate over time. Health packs are fairly common at first, but get rarer later on and are often hidden. Really captures the atmosphere of the dangerous, post-apocalyptic wilderness, where you are most absolutely nowhere near the top of the food chain. Albiet with some very nice views.  Money is scarce, making you truly work for each upgrade. You have to find 4 fragments that are put together to form a whole. And the cheapest updrade available that I found takes two. I have been playing for several hours now and have only been able to upgrade my dash once. I've played the game for a while and have gotten pretty comfortable most of the time. The bosses are still hard, and there's the occasional 'oh ♥♥♥♥' moment when you walk into a room and 20 enemies immediately ambush you.  Some easy tips for when you start: 1) Try playing both with a controller and with mouse/keyboard. I actually prefer m/k, despite what the game says. 2) Explore. Take every path you can find. It makes it much easier to find everything you need, as well as extra health kits and money. 3) Don't forget to use your gun. 4) Don't rely on the dash to much. It is often easier and safer to simply move out of the way than to try dashing to dodge every attack. 4) Can't interupt enemies attack animations. Dodge or finish them from a distance. Don't charge. 5) Use cover. Ducking behind a pillar or box will block enemy shots and allow you to focus on closer enemies. 6) Keep moving. Strafing or running in wide circles is usually enough to dodge ranged attacks and keep melee enemies from getting to close. 7) Don't try to dodge before enemies attack. The tracking is amazing in this game and they can instantly adjust to your new position if you dash. Wait until they attack, THEN dodge, otherwise you will almost definitely get hit. 8) Hitting things with your sword restores ammo. This includes breakable objects. 9) East path is the easiest, South path is blocked until the end. North path has obstacle courses. West path requires a lot of exploring, very maze-like. 10) East Boss spits explosive enemies. As soon as you see he's about to start, shoot at his mouth with your gun. This will often hit them as soon as they come out, knocking them back into the boss and exploding, which stuns him. 11) Remember to use your gun when fighting North Boss. Most of his attacks are predictable and can be avoided by moving just one square up or to the side. Look for the patterns. His final attacks where he carpet bombs the floor are only horizontal or verticle, and hit the same places each time. If you find a safe zone you can simply stand and shoot at him or heal. Remember to not rely on the dash to much. Remember to wait until he starts his attack before moving. 12) Don't play when you're frustrated. I usually take breaks when I notice I'm rushing and making mistakes. Especially with bosses. 13) Plan ahead. Don't simply bum rush enemies or do the some thing over and over. Try a different strategy if your current one isn't working. 14) Try not to panic",1,0

This system might have worked years ago when MMOs were still sort of a new thing but nowadays, people are smarter than that.   I mean, they still havea chance if they make everything from the cash shop available in the game. Like pets and upgrade stones, etc... Heck, the game is about grinding, why not add all the cash shop items as super rare drops. So the player has a choice of spending money OR getting lucky which would be fun.",-1,0

39140,FINAL FANTASY VII,"Final Fantasy VII.   For many, this is the game that started people on the Final Fantasy series, back in the day on the original Playstation. Good graphics, story, characters, and gameplay came together to form what is considered by many to be the best Final Fantasy game ever made.  However, that is not my opinion. I liked it, and it was good, but it wasn't the best. Still pretty high up on the list though!  Final Fantasy VII follows the story of Cloud Strife and a band of rebels known as AVALANCHE, as they struggle against the super conglomerate, Shinra INC. Along the way Cloud gets caught up in a battle to save the Planet itself! The story is decent, but at some points very predictable, but that's not the game's strong point(s).  The game features the ever-so-familiar ATB Battle System, used since Final Fantasy I. As a characters action bar fills, you can input commands for that turn in battle, be it magic, attacking, summoning, or using items. It also features the standard Experience PointS system commonly found in many, many RPGs. Defeating enemies earns you experience points, and when character reach a certain amount of points, they increase in level, which in turn increases their stats.   But what REALLY shines about Final Fantasy VII is the Materia system. As you progress through the game, you will be able to find and/or purchase small sphere-like objects called Materia that can be slotted into your weapons and armor. The color of the materia indicates what type it is. Green Materia teaches magic spells, Red Materia allows the user access to a special Summon creature, while Blue Materia adds support effects to any Materia it's connected to in your gear. For example, you can slot a green Cure Materia together with a blue All Materia to allow you to cast Cure on your entire party, or perhaps the Shiva Materia with the HP Absorb Materia, allowing you to heal HP equal to the amount of damage Shiva inflicts with her attack! The combinations are numerous, and offer some surprising depth to an otherwise simple battle system.   The music is simply great. Mr. Uematsu did a fantastic job, as always. Each song fits in very well to the segments of the game they play in, especially boss battles.   Characters are fairly interesting, ranging from an ex-SOLDIER to a flower girl from the slums to a robotic cat riding a giant stuffed moogle. In total, you will have 9 characters that you can add to your battle roster, and each one can be set up with the flexible materia system!  All-in-all, FInal Fantasy VII is a solid RPG, and a solid game. The main story alone will take you nearly 40 hours to complete, and if you are a completionist you get a whooping 100 or more hours of play!    Recommended ",1,1

207170,Legend of Grimrock,"Playing this with the sequel in mind, it's a much simpler, more confined experience, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Where the sequel is much more open and encourages exploration, this one's more about overcoming the dungeon before you, going deeper and deeper, floor by floor, as challenges and rewards alike escalate. You won't get lost, but you'll find plenty of secrets if you poke around a little. It's shorter, but there's much less time spent wandering.   Played without the sequel in mind, this is God's gift to dungeon-crawl fans, taking all the old-school things you enjoyed and decorating them in modern graphics and sound. It's not as hard, even on hard, as those older games, but it captures the spirit of them perfectly with solid mechanics and atmosphere. It's a fantastic adventure, even if the final act is a bit of a letdown, and well worth playing even if you've already played the fancier second game.",1,0

202170,Sleeping Dogs™,"I am by no means a perfect player, I do suck at many games and sure this is one of them, why not admit that, I see many die hard fans would attack people who criticise this game, so bring it on, for new players this game could be rather hard to start, I find that the so called open world setting is so far rubbish, and you are forced along a story path, so at least as far I can see there is no Open World at all, you either do the mission they hint at or you fail said mission, and fighting is (pun intended) hit and miss, sure it is basically the same as Batman, but without a game difficulty setting adjustment to use for bad players, this game is just a case of too many bad guys and too little health. and martial arts that might as well be mime.   were it not for the two things I already mentioned I would reatlly enjoy this one, it does have much going for it, if one can handle the combat system, and basically being outnumbered 6 to 1.  Hard to recommend so I won't, I suggest playing this on someone elses PC first and see if you like it or get the demo version first then decide.  After all this I still want to like the game.",-1,0
207000,Alien Spidy,"I played this game for 23 minutes and it was after the first 10 that I realised this game was not for me.  I've never been a big fan of games focused largely on getting high scores. This game is that type of game. It has levels that are divided into tiny segments that have you automatically respawn if you die, making each individual obstacle practically 'checkpointed' which while making the challenges more tolerable because you're not really set back at all by respawning, it kind of dramatically lowers the difficulty. That being said it's the kind of game that I imagine if I had sat down and played it properly then the later levels would not doubt be more difficult anyways.  The controls when using a gamepad are also terrible, they're tolerable when using a keyboard and mouse.  If you like games that present a bit of challenge and are focused on high scores then this bad boy is clearly for you, however I didn't like it.",-1,0

105600,Terraria,"  This game has got to be one of the best gifts. This game could be sold for $30 USD and still be worth it.  To start off, this game can suit any type of game player from a first-person shooter to a strategy/turn-based gamer. It is good for all ages too. This game has a wide expanse of what you can do from trying to defeat every boss with an OP laser gun that doesn't take any mana with that meteor suit you died 5 times to get from meteor heads, to getting every gun, or collecting all the items with references (For all you Whovians out there, there is a Fez with your name on it). This game can change dramatically from playthrough to playthrough, you don't get bored of it after one gameplay.  Lemme go over the multiplayer aspect. If you and your friends are looking for a chaotic game to play or for a peaceful game to play, buy the four pack. My friend did and he deserves an award for that. While it depends on who hosts the server, (and sometimes how good you connect to people) it is generally not laggy. I host nearly everytime, and everyone is fine about 90% of the time, but even then it is usually their internet having problems. Also, just hosting a world and only you playing is fine. Sometimes I have found hosting runs smoother than singleplayer, but that could just be me.  You wanna be creative? Go ahead, make anything. You wanna make a minigame? Go ahead, it's easy, not to mention with a few gems you can already have Capture the Gem (Capture the Flag). You wanna fight monsters? Feel free. You wanna blow things up? I'll run and hide. What you can do in this game is endless. I could say so much more, but I feel like I have the point across. If I had found out about this game sooner, I would've bought it.",1,0
311690,Enter the Gungeon,"Dark souls!? boys play dark souls. Men, now men play ETG.  ________________________________________________________________________________  Start the actual review: EtG is a bullet hell dungeon crawler game (With guns!) meaning its combat mechanics are quite similar to that of undertales, now I think about it... combat IS its only mechanic. It has 8 bit graphics (that work Reeeealy well)  Personally, I bloody love the game, wish I had more spare time to play it, but there are a few cons, and things I know some people won't like:  Pros: Simple and easy to learn Easy to have a quick 10 minute go inbetween all the things we have to do Hundreds of weapons, abilitys and Items to pick up. (albeit some more common than others) Highly addictive  Variables: Insanely hard to master (Seriously, my first 10 hours and I coulden't beat the first boss) Its 8 bit graphics (Imho they work really well, my friend tells me otherwise) Very similar to the binding of issac and its likes  Cons: Repetative enemys (They all look near enough the same inside there types, just a blue shell instead of a red shell, that fires a bit faster) Very minimal explanation as to why you are in the gungeon Repetative weapons (there are hundreds of different weapons, make no mistake, but most of them are super rare, theres about 10 that you will find every few runs)  My overall verdict: 9 /10.

Well, it's not too bad until you get to the first boss, and if you can beat that, you'll be mildly frustrated while figuring out the games other mechanics.   But then there's a hump, once you get passed a certain spot in the game, you'll be good to go. I don't know if it's because that part is extraordinarily hard and you master the game in that moment, or if it kinda slips down a difficulty slope and becomes easier after that. Whatever, it's pretty far in the game though.   This is a game I always had a browser running in the background for, because they only teach you the bare basics, and multiplayer makes this game easier, and somehow more fun at the same time. My first playthrough took 75 hours to complete, and my next playthrough is on track to be half of that.   Oh, but I heard Games for Windows Live is dying, and that's how the multiplayer works, so I'm not sure what the state of existence for this game is going to be after July or whenever that's happening.

I can't see any patterns to the movement of the market and cannot successfully complete all of the Tutorial game missions (I've completed the tutorial).  I'm disappointed with this game. I expected some form of data analyisis to assist me in my decision making - I played Eve Online for a LONG time and played the markets successfully there, so I'm not an idiot.  I wish it was a deeper game that I could get into .. it's likely going into my 'games collecting dust' folder. :(",-1,1

72000,Closure,"Let's get one thing straight: I'm a sucker for a novel premise. If a game brings forth something that I haven't seen, I've gonna play the game a lot. That's the biggest drawing point of this game - it takes the generic puzzle platformer and changes the mechanics of the game.  That being said, it has a lot of virtually soul-crushing moments, whether it's doing something blatantly wrong or 99% right with the 1% throwing you off the edge of a cliff. But that's what you buy a puzzle platformer like this for. You buy it for the mental and physical test, with willpower on top of it. This isn't Mario (farm 99 lives and blaze through most levels) and this isn't just a puzzle game.   It's a great package of art, music (startling moments of sound in game), and gameplay. It's short, but I'd definitely rank it pretty high on my list of games.  TLDR: If you like puzzle platformers, this game is worth it.",1,0

529110,Awkward Dimensions Redux,"Very weird game. At the beginning I wanted to write very critical review - about bad level creation, empty maps, repeating textures or very obvious level borders which makes the player feel like he is more in the cardboard game rather than true world. It was obvious to me that the developer is a freshman, just a guy who made few levels and wants to publish them on Steam. I understand it, because I want to do exactly the same.  But then something changed - I found the level with video of a boy (maybe it's the developer? I don't know) tearing apart furiously a bunch of papers. Around me were very critical one-sentenced reviews like 'waste of internet space', 'unoriginal content' etc. This game have a soul and this reason is enough to give it a try.  It's like collection of stories of unknown author. Some are good, some are terrible and put into just to fill the space. I have the feeling that author was inspired by 'The Beginners Guide' and history of Coda and wanted go into his steps - which I respect. In the criticion level we can hear a distorted music from this game. Some levels are quite interesting to explore. Some of them are terrible (but you can skip them from the menu). I hope that in the future an author will make a remake.  Anyway, very interesting experience, especially as free indie game on Steam.",1,0

I have only done 1 full playthrough taking about 140 hours to do all the content I could find. I'm on the fence about replayability but some players may enjoy doing romances, decisions and skill trees in a different direction than before. Even so, with only one time through doing all side content I definitely got my money's worth. Planning to try the DLC soon, I've heard good things. I would definitely reccomend for anyone who enjoys immersive RPG single player campaigns that give branching consequences for decisions. This is on my top ten list of most favorite games.",1,0

295750,The Floor is Jelly,"Cool looking platformer with tons of design problems. First off, it says controller support, but it actually doesn't work with a controller plugged in. Some people say if you plug in after the game it works, but it still didn't work for me. Its embarassing that in 2016 this game still doesn't have working controller support. Using the keyboard is just ok, but not great. It's worse because the platforming is imprecise. Your character moves side to side super fast and has so much momentum from 1 jump it's hard to adjust in the air, you just either have to hope you guess the right amount or you die and start again. This can be quit annoying. Wall jumping works sometimes, and othes you just slide down and fall. The floor and walls being jelly is a cool idea. The game problems come to a head with this terrible 'transparency' shifting platforms. There is literally no rhyme or reason to how they work. You just randomly jump and sometimes you can go through other times you can't It's not consistent, as times I should have been able to go through I couldn't. If you watch people play in walkthroughs its the same thing. Its more trial and error and luck than any sort of skill or puzzle solving. Its super annoying because with the wall jumping and the bad platforms, you can ge through 2/3 random luck parts of these and if you die on the 3rd you need to restarts entire level. Its just terribly done and in no way made sense and they haven't fixed how buggy it is. Other times I would fall through solid blocks. There's no story. Even the first level where it all starrs has no directions and you just hammer keys. Looks cool and has some fresh ideas, as well as relaxing music, but terrible game design and imprecise and finnicky platform mechanics all bog it down and make it not worth playing.  3.5/10",-1,1

The difficulty curve is great, the games starts out with easy battles and simple puzzles and builds in difficulty throughout the entire game to nerve wracking battles and extremely challenging puzzles. The visuals are outstanding, but the same stone walled environments get really repetitive and boring after awhile.

Or maybe you won't, I mean who can really tell with this one. Over however long in development, with countless engine updates, and one or a million developer changes, I still to this day, have no idea why so many knuckleheads held this game to such high standards. I suppose it was their undying love and fond memories for the Duke Nukem of the 90's, but still, how good could this game have been when it was passed around more times than some lame joke about a girl who is very promiscuous? Actually...pretty damn good, if you ask me!  This game was destined to fail ever since year five in development, so it really doesn't matter now, but like I said, if you were a fan of the original 'Duke 3D' game, then this game should be pretty enjoyable for you. Or maybe it won't be, who cares, either way get f'd and buy it cheap. But still, 'Forever' manages to be more imaginative than 75% of new shooters out there today and maintains some of the humor and feel of gameplay from the original. The storyline is the same 'save the world from the aliens' but what else did you expect, and each map feels fresh and fun to play through each and every time, with small puzzles and challenges along the way.  Overall, this is a game most people have most likely already forgotten about, but it's still incredibly fun if you ask me. And even though it's probably not the game that the developers originally set out to make, I'm still thankful to have been able to play this version. So pick this one up for a few bucks during the next sale if you're a fan of Duke Nukem or shooters in general. Because 'Forever' is a pleasant change from the mundane, everyday shooters that most people play day in and day out.",1,1

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"In a world in which Free to Play games exist, a concept like this has no more place. Even at its already reduced price tag the game is just not worth it.  But this is not the reason i do not recommend it. My reason not to recommend it, are the controls. The gunplay feels off and the movement controls are strange. Most importantly, they are designed for a gamepad and the gamepad wouldn't be turned off in the options and is per default activated. The shooting feels unsatifying. The monster controls are ackward with mouse and keyboard.  Some people might say now that i haven't spend enough time with the game, but really, why force yourself to play a game you do not enjoy playing? To justify the purchase price. But considering i played the game on a Free Weekend, i don't have the incentive to give the game more of my time.   Its just not fun. Being forced into a certain weapon type because of the character you like was also something incredibly off putting. Why can't i use the gun i want to use?  In terms of gameplay... the game is hide and seek, until the monster got fat enough to take out the humans. That means you end up running after the monster (or running from the hunters)... so you are playing a shooter in which one side is supposed to avoid the other side, until its so beefy that it can take out 4 people.  As monster i found the tactic to focus down on the healer until they couldn't be revived anymore, to be most successful. At which point you can just run away, heal up and the hunters will lose. Take out the medic, then the trapper. At that point the hunters can just give up.  Its just boring. And if the gun play would be more fun, maybe i would have dug it more, but it just isn't enjoyable to me. It feels floaty and lacking any sort of impact. Humongous gun models that take up about 1/4 of the screen... and feel like pea shooters. What the hell do you need all that gun for, if its bullets feel like its a BB gun?  I gave it a chance to convince me... and it failed. Having over 200 bucks worth of DLC also is another major turn off, regardless of what that DLC might be.",-1,0

301970,Screencheat,"Screencheat is a crazy game about looking at the other players' screens to see where they are, and then proceeding to run them over with a toy horse, shoot them through a wall, blow them up with a teddy bear, or whack them to death with a fish.  As you can tell from the name, the videos and the screenshots, the game is splitscreen, and everyone is invisible. You have to locate the other players by screencheating, and then go and kill them. Every kill is satisfying. A ragdoll flops into existence when someone dies, and the ragdoll models include fish-people and chickens. There is an announcer, whose accent can be changed in the options. My personal favourite is the Australian announcer :D  There are 10 maps, which are well designed and colour-coded so that you can easily tell which area someone is in. There are 10 weapons, which are all unique. There are several different gamemodes, such as CTF (Capture the Fun), Deathmatch, KOTH, Murder Mystery (you are assigned a target that you must kill to gain points), and Juggernaut, to name a few. The gamemodes can be played FFA or in teams. There are also several server mutators which can be activated to create an even more hilarious/weird experience, like huge ragdolls, and Australian mode.  The game supports up to 8 players on a server. 4 players is a nice number, but a full server of 8 is pure insanity, and it's wonderful. You can play local or online multiplayer, or both at once.  You gain exp by playing, and as you level up you unlock bonus ragdolls (such as a hotdog) and weapon skins (such as the Cod of Duty skin for the melee weapon).  Overall it's a really fun game, and it's even more fun if you have friends to play with. It would probably be a great party game. There are so many funny moments, but it can be quite competitive too, and it gets pretty intense sometimes. But it's always fun! The game needs more people playing it, so buy it sometime!",1,1

322520,Dynasty Warriors 8 Empires,"Though I do recommend the game, I'd suggest looking through gameplays in order to decide whether or not the game is worth buying at such a high price. Because I've loved the series since the 5th expansion, I've tried my hardest to keep up with the newest releases, so this game was no different.  This, however, is my first Empires game. I do love the variety in scenerios that I can possibly get (the smallest decisions can make big impacts on yourself and your timeline, you can start off as a ruler or free officer, virtue points, quests, etc.) and the ability to create a character, marry, and have a child you can play with and eventually save and play yourself.  There's a wide variety of customizations for CAW and unlocking weapons has gotten so much more easier than in previous games (in which I'm speaking from a DW5, DW8XL point of reference) where you can buy the weapons with points that you earn in game rather than hoping for them to drop or objectives or DLC.  It can get repetitive in terms of gameplay, but a lot of other popular games can do the same so what makes it different?  10/10",1,0

620,Portal 2,"When I had a chance to play Portal 2 at my friend's house one day, I knew this would have to be one of the first games I buy on Steam. Many puzzle games have the fault of being too difficult, unoriginal, and ultimately having low replayablility because puzzles you've already figured out once are no fun. This game throws all those faults in the garbage. While the game was very difficult, and I have been stuck on the same level for an hour once or twice, I never felt like the game was unbeatable, and I enjoyed it very much. The portal gun is also one of the most original game items I have ever encountered, and I never get tired of using it. Lastly, it is one of the most replayable puzzle games yet. For one, the co-op mode is very fun, and while even if you already beat it once, the experience can be completely different depending on who you play with, so it's always fun to play it with someone new. There's also the feature of community test chambers made by you, the players. Now you have to download the chambers, so depending on what computer you're playing it on, you can't just play community test chambers until you die, but it's always fun to see what other people come up with.",1,0

Glorious, ridiculous, to the point. Shocked such a dumb premise got greenlit by a big pub. Glad it did. The game is fun, very much so but I advise against clearing the strongholds. I did a couple after every main mission and it totally broke the pacing. It's boring, repetitive and not worth it. You get one to two side missions in every liberated garrison but they are copy-paste small mindless chores after the first few times. They unlock one weapon modification in the in-game store but honestly, they are not worth it. Most are just needless while others are way overpowered and take any challenge out of the already easy game. But most of all, they brake the otherwise perfect pacing of the game. Forget about garrisons and any other side occupation, just focus on the main missions which are great fun. Cutscenes and story were absurd, stupid fun and the soundtrack is just a gem. Went for all stereotypical action movie cliche and it just fits.   Give this one a go, it's short and sweet.",1,0

261030,The Walking Dead: Season Two,"10/10. I do not give these lightly.  I mean, to be honest it's not really much of a game at all - it is ridiculously easy, has even less puzzles than season 1 (and the season 1 puzzles were easy anyway) - there is really no 'gameplay' to speak of, and if the writing and characterization were not so PHENOMENAL then this would be a really bad thing.  But since it is executed so perfectly, with meaningful (and TOUGH) decisions, genuine plot twists, and a meticulously planned story arc (replete with clever foreshadowing and complex open-ended moral questions), the fact that there are little 'find and hunt' puzzle solving or other genre tropes are really a positive thing here, since they don't get in the way of the story which is REALLY worth paying attention to. I was 'on the edge of my seat' not out of horror or tension created by the potential of 'losing' but because I genuinely cared about what was going to happen next, and knew that I had a part to play in that.   Without question this is a better 'Walking Dead' vision than the television show (which I like despite its flaws) and I really hope this company succeeds and continues producing stuff like this. Even between Seasons 1 and 2 there is a definite progression and refinement of style. Looking forward to more.  Also William Carver (voiced by Michael Madsen!) is everything that they wanted 'The Governor' to be and failed at. A convincing villain with realistic motivations who you can easily picture as once being a 'good guy' (and even still thinking of himself as one - which in my opinion is the mark of the best villains).",1,0

292140,FINAL FANTASY XIII-2,"I'll start this review with the obvious, that I am sure most reading will have seen time and time again. Yes. The graphical capabilities of this game on the PC are untrue. It runs slower than 60fps, sometimes dropping quite low in more intense battles / larger view battles. This is nota fault of anyone's PC, but how the game was programmed with the PS3 in mind, a poor architecture. It does not make use of the full capabilities of GPUs or Multi-core CPUs, therefore it will run similarly on older computers as it might on a state of the art. The software is the limit, not the hardware.  That said, I do have an older PC. I played in a 720P window at that resolution using the smallest shadow-map, and 2x MPAA. It ran alright for the most part. As I said, it had it's slow moments, but was hardly unplayable as some might have suggested. I do play modern games at post 60fps, but do not find low FPS to be a kill all. I could probably have upped the shadow and AA and still been fine. No crashes, no critical flaws to the game in that regard. I could have been lucky, but that was my experience.  Now then, on to the game review itself. Would I recommend this game? Yes.  The story I find rather touching, if a little too sappy at times. I don't find it really killed the story of the first, but rather fleshes it out. The combat remains quite close to Final Fantasy 13, which is a plus, albiet there are times when I felt it was overly easy comparatively(explained later). The 'time-traveling' and 'gate-closing' mechanics give you chances to go back and redo areas to complete them differently where available. Unlike Final Fantasy 10-2, you do not need to replay the game through from the start multiple times to see everything. You will need to replay sections, but so far nothing I have seen too much repeating. The world is definitely more 'open' than it was in the first game. There is more to explore than narrow hallways. Still very closed in spaces comapred to /world maps/ in the older games, but better.  Now for the things I did not care for.   'Ease' of Battles: Battling in 13 seemed a bit more tactical than it is in 13-2. I attribute this to the libra spell which you could cast at will in the first game. In this game, there are librascopes you can find or buy for exorbitant prices about mid-game, but no actual simple libra-spell to get data on monsters initially. This means the game can't be too harsh for not paying complete attention to the monsters while you fight them. Without foreknowledge of the enemies, you just have to constantly hit them until information is revealed, often through multiple encounters. If you don't avoid fighting a long way through the game, most your 'random' battles until the very end will revolve around three commandos just nuking everything with blitz and ruinga. Auto-battle will be used overall, as very rarely do you need to worry about selecting proper skills.  Not to say that there are no times it's better to manually control, especially if less than ideally leveled, but mostly that revolved around me applying proper debuffs to certain enemies. In that regard though, I felt a lot of the battles could just be brute-forced compared to 13, with only a few that it really mattered to focus on it all. Many times, if you didn't care about time too much, having a strong sentinal member(not too hard to get early on, and upgrade later) could really ease it.  Speaking of character classes...   The '3rd wheel' as it were of your 3rd party member. Rather than a single character with multiple classes, you capture and raise various monsters for the roles. Each monster only has a single role, and you can only have 'equipped' 3 monsters at a time to fill various roles. For the most part, this isn't a big deal... Raising them isn't too specifric unless you need uber monsters to help the uber enemies situation. Even then, I don't see the value in perfectly upgraded partners.  And speaking up upgrades...   The crysterium is very lack luster to me compared to the first game. I liked how you could choose which class to level in what order in the first game, but each character would ultimately max out at a certain stat level when all was finished. In the first game, you had a max level for a given area, which forced more strategy on the player as they could no brute force it as much.   This game? Regular battles are basically infinite CP batteries. You will be maxed well before the end of the game, unless you really rush. How you level though, is is a single crysterium for all classes on each character. Depending which class you level though at different points in the crysterium(including even/odd levels on some classes) gives different bonus stats. In short, there is an ideal way of leveling each character, while others could leave you with somewhat less than great stats, depending which all you leveled. Nothing game-breaking, but if you are a perfectionist, prepare to study and research ideal leveling order.  Lastly, a few of the 'fragments' in the game are a real time-sink and pain to get. Grinding certain enemies to get a lot of gil to just dump. At one point, taping a button on the controller down on the slot machines just to make sure I win a certain amount over a few hourts while I browsed the web. Battling every enemy at least once, including rare enemies and some that have a 50% chance of not spawning at all on a run through an area before you have to reset the area and try again. Making sure to explore every last detail of every map for 100% completion. Just... tedium work, really.   That aside, I do not regret this purchase. It fixes some of the problems I had with FF13, but introduces different naggings. Despite my naggins though, I felt compelled to play it through and enjoyed the ride. A few points that were dull busy work, but overall a fun game. Just be prepared to look to the next game if you want any sort of conclusion, because this one literally pulls a Halo 2 with a 'To Be Continued...'",1,0

349720,Audition Online,"I have played this game for around 6-8 years, I didn't keep count. It is a bit challenging, but that's the fun in it. Not all games are supposed to be simple. What may remind you of DDR, is not at all the same. You do have to press notes, but you have to finish a bar of notes before the ball reaches the end. Sounds confusing? Well you should be trying it out for yourself! Over the years, I have practiced and learned to get better. Not only do you get better, but you also make a lot of friends along the way.   The Community in Audition is great. I guess you could say I'm one of the old players. I started when it was in Nexon, and I continued with it when it continued to Redbana. I met tons of friends that I am still friends with today, and I still talk with them. They're great for lending a hand in helping you complete missions, helping you level up, etc. It's never a dull moment playing with fun people.  You can join a Fam (similar to a guild) whose members are just as helpful, you can have a couple, and eventually get married and have a ring, exclusive clothes and exclusive missions. It's not JUST a dancing game. There are many modes in which you can play, and each mode is different. If you think one mode isn't for you, then don't worry about it because the next one is something different. Try it out :)  You can always message me for help, I'll always be around.

525610,Hardware Engineering,"UPDATE: Purchased this at release and asked for refund due to some issues that were met. According to the dev the issues were fixed but I have yet to retry everything again due to having some problems with my card transaction on Steam so it's not currently allowing me to repurchase the game.   I will, however, be changing the review to a THUMBS UP for the reason that the developers are listening to the community and still fixing the game and also because it's a DAMN GOOD CONDEPT of a game. It would be great to see more 'Engineering' games coming form the studio.  Having said that if you haven't read the other reviews then still be aware that it is an Online only game. I'm not an expert but I think the game is suffering from whatever engine it's running on. There was a problem with performance especially deleting wires and there is an option for playing it on a browser. Again, not an expert but if the game is natively running on browser with a windows 'wrapper' then that might be the reason it can't be optimized properly. If the game performance itself would be fixed then this would be the perfect game of its kind, or maybe the only one.  ---------------------------------- OLD REVIEW ----------------- Wonderful concept - instant purchase. Doing the second tutorial but it's 'stuck' in simulation. Pretty sure the circuit is correct but I'm not sure if it's still doing it or it's stuck since there's no indication on what part of the simulation it currenty is on.  EDIT:  Btw, just a note for anyone wondering since the gamelay is node-based, connections don't stick to the nodes so if you move a node to another place the wiring still is left for you to reconnect/remove.  EDIT2: For anyone wondering about the 'bug'. According to the forums all you need to do is connect branching wires from the source itself not from any part of the wire. It's counter intuitive but it will get you going. Also consider that the optimization is currently very bad. Deleting wires take several seconds as experienced by other users from the discussions as well.   I'm optimistic everything will get fixed and will update the reveiew if ever it gets done.",1,0

289070,Sid Meier's Civilization VI,"I'm new to Civ Series, and am enjoyinging the game very much. The game provides a wide range of experience for both skilled and unexperienced players. I had a lot of fun discovering all the game mechanics.   Of course there are flaws with the current build. For example, some mechanics are not well-explained (why can't my archers shoot targets that are 2 tiles away? I found out eventually by experimenting but 'line of sight' is not properly explained even in the Civilopedia). There are also numerous bugs such as victory not triggering and game crashing when conquering a city on the side of the map. As a Chinese national, I am also more comfortable to play the game in English because the Chinese translation has a lot of errors and inconsistencies (not translators' fault; the way the texts are formatted in the source code doesn't give translators enough context to translate 100% accurately).   Despite all that, I find the game really enjoyable. City planning, music, making best use of each civ's unique abilities to optimize, etc are all great. For now, I believe Firaxis will listen to player's needs and fix as many problems as possible in the next patch.",1,0

In this game the score maxes out at 2.1 billion and you get an achievement but THE COUNTER STOPS GOING. That is a horrible, game-breaking thing to do to an old-school styled arcade shooter.

Maybe it's because of my 56 hours on the 360 I'm more used to it, but I feel the default mapped controls are awkward.   * Game can be annoying when searching for an online match, IE you get thrashed in a lobby, so you want to find a new one, game puts you in the exact same lobby you were in before.   * Not a true con in itself, but the tracks are supposed to be based off locations found in that game's universe.

353270,Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3 V Generation,"100% all 3 of the Neptunia games and they tried to do it a bit different in this one, which is not always good.  First what i liked:  + They removed share character locks, share endings or having way to many endings + Its Neptunia what can you say more   Now what i dont like:  - They added an item that you only can get 1 time per true ending and is needed to make some of the best weapons in the game, which is really dumb and just a cheap way to replay the game - They added the achievement system from Fairy Fencer and you are forced to do specific tasks to unlock really important plans for each character which gets annoying - This game is probably the grindiest one of all Neptunia games, because there is really no fast way to make xp and money like in the other games, where you got a lot in the colosseum in a decent amount of time - They also increased the prices for items in the shop by a lot, for example each best weapon in the game cost 10million alone, not even speaking of all the other stuff you can buy, which is also a really cheap way to extend the play time  So overall they tried to change a few things which are good but the most changes they did i really dont like its just like they wanted to extend the game time by making one time items, enormous prices, annoying achievements and really low xp and money rate to make it a grind fest. Dont get me wrong i have nothing against grinding but as someone who always wants to 100% a game this seems way to much, gets boring and is really just a cheap way to make the game last longer.

In my experience, the Mass Murderer FPS mod is the best way to play the game. It's rough on the GPU, but it gives you a personal perspective on the action, and is especially more satisfying to view executions in.   Overall, it's a decent game.

239120,Final Fantasy III (3D Remake),"  Quick review:  +Fun battle system +Fun development system +Interesting world +Good writing  -Story feels its age -Development system lacks any major depth -Convoluted magic system -Difficulty curve is weird    *This review is based on the game Final Fantasy III, not just this particular port*    Final Fantasy III is a mixed bag that shows it age but still remains solid in gameplay, development and fun.    The story is standard fare, you play as an orphan collecting crystals and saving the world. Obviously there are more nuances there, but this is where the game truly feels its age with each character essentially being a blank canvas. The writing is interesting enough to offset the generic overtones though, it's generally something that Square are very good at. I want to emphasize that the story itself isn't bad though, you just shouldn't go in expecting something incredible.    (There's nothing wrong with this trope, seeing as Square was a large part of its popularity)    The gameplay is traditional turn based, using your agility stat to determine where you appear in a queue. Some abilities have higher priorities and will therefore be used first, if your agility equals someone elses.  The development system uses the Job system, and FFIII was the first Final Fantasy that let you freely change jobs outside of battle. You have jobs like White Mage (healer), Black Mage (nuker) and Knight (tank). There are lots of jobs to use, and you can make a party of your choosing. The development system is  relatively  shallow, but has enough depth to keep things interesting. This system was then perfected in Final Fantasy V. (steam release please)  The Magic system is a little bit iffy, instead of having a standard MP pool, you have a number of uses tacked on to each level of magic (which raises through levels) which means you could use nine level 1 spells and still use a level 2 spell after that, assuming you had charges for level 2 magic. You're also limited to only 3 slots per level of magic, meaning you have to make a decision on which magicks you want to use (especially if you use a red mage) I feel like they improved on this in subsequent titles. (MP pool, no choosing magicks)  The difficulty curve can make the game frustrating at points and too easy at other points, but it's never unfair or completely simple.  Visually the game looks OK. I've never personally been a fan of the DS esque chibi art though, so take that with a grain of salt. The game itself upscales pretty well, and looks nice on the PC unless you stare too intently and some of the textures.  The controls are ok, and very intuitive if you're using a controller and you've ever played another Final Fantasy game. The menus can be a bit sluggish sometimes, but it's never to the point of frustration. The zoom feature can be a pain sometimes too, but again it's never  too  bad.  Is this game worth the price tag? Yes and no. You will get £11($17)'s worth of content out of the game, but it does seem a little pricey seeing as this is a port of a port, and considering that you can buy FFVII and VIII for so cheap on steam currently. If you're a fan of the series or want a solid turn based RPG to keep you busy for a while, then I'd suggest picking it up. If you're unsure then I would wait until it comes on sale.  Oh and the music? The music is fantastic.",1,0

221380,Age of Empires II (2013),"This was my old review:  Very disappointing! Loved the original and was excited for some nostalgia gaming, but instead the program fails with an error every time. Claims that my system's GPU does not meet minimum requirements, which is absurd given it is using a newer nvidia card that runs much newer games with ease. Very shoddy work.  However, with recent updates it's now able to play on the same system. It's a major nostalgia trip to play this. If you were into this game the first time around, go for it. If this is your first time, some of it will probably seem primative. It's like watching old 'I love lucy' episodes. The stuff that seems old and tired now was slick and new when this came out.",1,0

234330,Marvel Puzzle Quest,"This is a fun game if you like Bejeweled or any similar game. It's also a lot of fun if you're a big Marvel fan. It's a game of matchup, where matches damage the enemy and build access to bonuses. New heroes are buyable as you progress. Since it is a F2P game, the catch is that if you want to heal or progress faster, you have to pay. A good mind exercise for the day. :)",1,0
65800,Dungeon Defenders,I honestly hate most wave challenges and defence games. For some unknown reason this game does it in a way that it's action packed enough for me to fall in love with it.

Not enough games on Steam are split screen capable and even fewer are as well done as this game. I recommend this game for anyone to buy.,1,0

234140,Mad Max,"I didn't expect this to be as good as it is, usually very untrusting of movie adaptions but the devs actualy give sh*t about this game and it's not the usual blatant money grabbing from WB.  After Batman (the new sh*tty one) where they actually had to take it off and repair the game, I thought this wouldn't be well optimised but it is, very well, I'm almost in disbelief. It runs on my fx-6300 and R9 270x (4gb) at around 70fps consistently on high settings.   The game looks f*cking amazing as well, the environments are beautiful and the particle effects are great but the characters don't really share the same level. They look just a bit samey and kinda stand out from the environment for not looking as good.   The driving is pretty good, it takes getting used to though and a controller might be better as it's not often you need to aim and even then it's in slo-mo (except sniper/shotgun). Vehicles to tend to feel a bit sluggish but the sense of speed is good. Car upgrades are pretty powerful, but in harder sections the more difficult cars need some serious gear to take down easily (upgrade the sh*t out of the harpoon).  There's loads to do as well, multiple sectors of increasing difficulty to play with by destroying oil camps, legions, top brass or scarecrows. What's good is it doesn't feel that repetitive, not sure why but I actually feel like I want to go and 100% everything, never been like that before.   Combat is mostly melee which works like batman or AC, parry and attack, dodge that, shoot them if need be. It's fun but not as fluid as batman and doesn't have as many moves. Still works great though, although there's a move I just learnt where you snap their arm, like fully it goes backwards, and they just get back up and are fine?? Doesn't really make sense, would be better if they just used other limbs instead or just stayed on the floor in pain.  Health is replenished by water/food which is kinda easily found, same for ammo although you can hold like one shell to begin with... Also fuel is used up by driving which needs replenishing after a couple hours-ish. Again no big problem.   The story is like most open world games in that it shows you being all badass, get f*cked up and have to rebuild. The end goal is to get to the plains of silence or something, basically just have peace. It's decent enough but don't expect Metal Gear level.   Overall it's a great game.   ",1,0

242920,Banished,"I like the game. It is very addictive. I guess I have spent a few hours playing it. There are of course things I don't like just as there are things I do like. I like SimCity games and this is a very good game of that type, which is why I bought it and why I play it. While I think the game is very playable it does tend to get boring after a while.The reasons are I run out of things I can do. Since the only way to be successful in the game is to have a happy and growing population, I feel there should be some way to help that growth along since just building a few houses doesn't do it. Also I think some of what the traders come to trade with are way to high as it is very very hard to build up much of any kind of surplus to trade with. Plus I would like to see more things..Uhmm like flour grinding mills for example. Bakeries perhaps, make more jobs available for the population. The few professions in the game is basically what any town needs to grow. But there is room for growth beyond just surviving one disaster after another. Plus it would be nice to see some building changes, ie: add ons or something besides just stone to brick. I get over a hundred population in the town and I started getting bored as nothing changes or there is nothing I can do to change the look of the town beyond a basic scheme. Which is okay and I am not complaining as I like the game and suggest it to everyone. But I am suggesting changes and things that would make the game much more enjoyable. As far as problems or gremlins I didn't experience any of those. The game played very well on my system and doesn't take but a moment or so to load up. It is a very addictive Sim building game but I would like to see it developed much more as like I said I get a little bored after about a hundred pop and I am looking for that reset button so I can start again.",1,0

341730,Dustoff Heli Rescue,"Having not watched the trailer, the biggest surprise for me was that the game is played in 2d rather than 3d. That is to say you control the left/right movement and also up/down (altitude) and that's it, meaning no third dimension to roam in. So it's an on-rails shooter where I was expecting more of a simulator, arcadish but still. Since it's also on smartphones though, it makes plenty of sense the gameplay is such.  The game itself is addictive. I was tempted to complete everything in one sitting, that's how much fun I was having. War is depicted in a cartoonish and nonjudgmental vein that I like very much. There are two control schemes available which provide varying amounts of frustration. The achievements are not hard at all. For people seeking additional replay value there is an (entirely optional) set of collectibles. The 3 weapons are quite distinct from each other - each is best suited to a particular situation so the first one can remain relevant even in the final missions. All in all, this was pure casual bliss.",1,0

345370,TyranoBuilder Visual Novel Studio,"Tyranobuilder,  Is, basically, like the big brother of Novelty; a freeware Visual Novel engine that does the same, but in a somewhat more complex way.

The only thing that TyranoBuilder does NOT do for you is to come up with a good story and personal artwork. Which is a pretty important aspect when it comes down to this.  So, would I recommend it? I give it a yes, because I do have some experience in designing VN's through other applications and TyranoBuilder is by far the 'fastest' to get a presentable result. Ofcourse, the quality of your production all comes down to your own creative / writing skills and you won't puff out a quality product in just 10 hours.

Now we have a sequal that's more polished, longer, expands on the cannon of the game, new testing elements, a two player co-op campaign, and a level editor which lets you play fan made puzzles. There was nothing in that sentence I didn't like. From my personal experience the platforming and portal aiming was not quite as crisp and clean as in the original but that's the worst criticism I can think for it. And who knows? Maybe I had the frame rate or resolution too high. See, look at what just happened there. The game is so good that I'm apologizing to it for accusing it of something not being perfect.

It's another of my childhood games that continues the story of George and Nicole from the excellent prequel - this time around centering the story around Mayan mythology. It's not a very long or difficult game and it doesn't have the same depth as the first did, but it's still a nice ride from start to finish. Fortunately Nicole is a much more important character this time around, and not just a lazy sidekick sitting on her butt in Paris most of the time. The game is much more linear than the first game - there are no maps or locations and they always follow one path. The graphics looks much better though with beautiful 2D art and gorgeous lush locations.   Definitely a game any point-and-click adventure fan should already have played.",1,0
305640,Shattered Planet,"Action games are great but sometimes we desire to play more relaxing games. This doesn't necessary mean the game can't be challenging but it should instead focus on strategy over reflexes. Shattered Planet is wonderful example of a fast-paced, exciting, game that does not require split-second decisions. This modern-day rogue-like is an excellent example of how to make a turn-based game exciting. The core gameplay is extremely straight forward but beneath the surface is a hearty amount of depth. Anyone looking for a more laid-back challenge with the variety of procedural generated content needs to check out Shattered Planet.  The story, if there is any, revolves around these worlds that are being ripped apart by the Blight. Every time you transport down to the surface the Blight slowly grows out from the spot you start on; in turn tainting the wild life and spawning monsters. Its your job to scavenge as many tools and resources you can while you search for the exit teleport pad. If you die you'll lose all your items however you will keep any experience and scrap you find. The aforementioned items can be used to upgrade your stats or purchase new equipment. Between constantly learning from your mistakes and having stronger, better equipped, characters you should be able to get farther and farther when you set out to explore new planets.  The gameplay is where this game really shines. The level are laid out in a grid format with small chucks of land connected via a couple of thin bridges. You can only see so far and the levels basically become a maze as you search for the exit. Whether your just moving around or fighting off hostile creatures you just simply click each time you wish to move a space or attack your enemy. Since this game is turn-based everything else will only move when you do, giving you all the time in the world to think and strategize. This is really helpful when you are trying to flee from and enemy or just avoid combat all together.  The procedural generation in this game is incredible. Although the level layouts don't vary a ton there are still many different planets and you still never know what you'll find. There a many different enemies and even some friendly natives. You'll come across several different colored capsules and you won't know if they are aids or weapons till you use one; even then the colors are randomized every time you play. There are also many objects or people you can interact with that will give you a scenario with two different choices. Usually the right choice, if there is one, isn't obviously or sometimes the choices just offer two different rewards. This a game you can play for hours on end and not find everything it has to offer.  If you are looking for a deep and relaxing game to play after a hard days work this is it. Shattered Planet is easily one of the best rogue-likes since Spelunky and that is saying a lot. This is one of the most fast-paced and exciting turn-based games I've ever played. The progression of your characters stats along side your ability to play well means every record you break in the endless mode is very satisfying. Even with the tremendous variety found in this title the core gameplay can start to get a bit repetitive because of its simplicity. That being said I believe the developers made the right call because there is already a flooded market of really deep RPGs. Shattered Planet is laid-back gaming at its best with near perfect balance of pacing and challenge.",1,0

I rate this game also a 10 out of 10  System.out.print('Its everything I wanted and feels like a Metal Gear Solid, Splinter Cell hy-brid')  ",1,0
252950,Rocket League,"Every now and again I think about gaming and what games are like in a modern era, compared to its origins. Sometimes I ask myself 'What makes a game, a game?'   A game's technical core needs to present the player with at least one thing: an objective - even if the objective is 'no objective' (thanks for the philosophy lesson, Geddy Lee).    Get A over to B.

327890,I Am Bread,"My opinion about the game overall: If you were expecting a funny/punny review then you came to the wrong review. I decided to make an actual helpful/serious review for the game. Let me start off saying this is a really great game and is a real and serious game despite looking like a joke, back when I saw this game in Greenlight I laughed and gave it a vote expecting it to be a game that wouldn't even get to a full release, when it first came out my friend bought it so I went to his place and played it for a few hours, after playing it a few times I decided to buy i. Aas it got more and more updates it got better. A lot of people say the game is hard to play with a keyboard but I disagree, back when I first played the game I didn't have a controller so I played it with a keyboard, after a while, I got a controller, and the only thing that was hard about playing with a controller was that sometimes I got confused with the buttons' names, overall it's better with a controller. Awesome game, they really put a lot of work to it and listened to the community throughout the making of the game. Cons and pros: +Remappable keyboard controls +Changable sensitivity +Graphic options also pretty customizable +Great graphics +Great support from the devlopers of the game in issues you might run into +Achievements -Controls can take time to get used to -New players can sometimes be annoyed by the game's challenge but that's pretty subjective Gamemodes:  Story mode: At the beginning of each level you are presented with some sort of letter about an insane guy who's also the house owner, you finish reading it or skip it and you then spawn as a piece of bread at the start of the level, at some levels you have extras you can add to yourself like jam and butter which have some side effects. You travel through the level possibly using various objects on the way to eventually get to the toaster or pan or whatever else you want to fry yourself on, in most levels there is more than one way to toast yourself. You get a grade based on your edibility, tastiness and possibly your time but I'm not sure about that, grades are from A++ from F(you only get f if you didn't finish the level). Story mode is overall challenging and my personal favorite. There are 8 levels in the story mode game mode.  Bagel Race: In this gamemode you spawn as a bagel in a different spawn than your spawn points at Story Mode, you need to run through the map using 3 and 4 keys(by default assuming you're using the keyboard) and the mouse and pass through checkpoints on the way to the end, you get a grade based on how fast you completed the race. There are 8 levels in the bagel race game mode. You have no edibility in this game mode.  Rampage: In this game mode you play as a baguette. In this mode your goal is to cause as much damage as possible to various objects around the level, the more damage you cause the better grade you are gonna get. You have multiplier for everytime you smash a few things at once. You have no edibility in this game mode. Rampage has 8 levels. You have a time limit at this game mode.  Cheese hunt: In this game mode you play as a crackbread. In this game mode you spawn as crackbread and start wandering around to find cheese and touch it so it sticks to you, as far as I know there are 5 pieces of cheese in each level. you lose ediblity by falling and/or hitting something too hard. You have no time limit in this game mode. There are 8 levels to Cheese Hunt.  Zero G(ravity): In this game mode you play as a slice of bread. This game mode is pretty much the same as the regular gamemode only there isn't gravity and you need to fly around with jets attached to you. I cannot explain the controls to this game mode as they are very complicated to explain, the main difference from the main game mode is that your grade is also based off the amount of fuel you've used up(You have infinite fuel, you use up fuel when you use your jets). You have edibility in this game mode, you lose ediblity when you touch the floor as far as I know. There is no time limit in this game mode. There are 8 levels to Zero G(ravity).  I'll edit this to explain about the gamemodes left soon.",1,1

The minimalis take on the inventory system means inventory managenment is a thing of the past. The difficulty is adequate for those looking for a challenge while the upgrades reward both the newcomers and action RPG veterans alike. Hyper Light Drifter does not hold your hand, there are no toturial or helpful hints you learn through trial and error and death. The story of Hyper Light Drifter is unconventional but it nevertherless draws you in, you want to explore the mesmerizing yet dilapidated tempels and forests.

286570,F1 2015,"Update 3 : 21/08/15 : Man, this game just keeps getting worse. I now get full AI opponents in a multiplayer lobby. THat's it. I'm never paying for a Codemasters F1 game ever again.  Update 2 : 04/08/15 : This edit is regarding the 31/07 patch. After playing the game for 4 days after the patch, it seems like the Codies are making slow progress towards fixing the patches. A lot of annoying bugs have been ironed out and framerates during gameplay is also much better but they have yet to fix one major issue with this game and that is MULTIPLAYER. It is more broken now than ever. I just can't find one single lobby or hopper or whatever they're calling it now to play in. This needs a fix and my review will stay negative till then.   Update 1 : 23/07/15 : Okay, it seems the 20/07 patch pushed in by the codies has fixed a few issues like framerate drops and crashes but it does not fix ALL the issues. There are still a few stutters here and there and needs a lot more fixing. The multiplayer is still broken and I'm still getting kicked from sessions for no bloody reason so my recommendation is still a NO.   ORIGINAL REVIEW : This game...this could be so much more than it is right now. I don't know where to begin. This game is just BROKEN.  The graphics are an obvious improvement from the previous titles and the handling seems a bit realistic than before but you buy racing games to have fun and I don't think I've had much fun with this game until now.  The game is marred with bugs and the multiplayer is just broken. I joined a hopper sprint in excitement to play my first ever multiplayer online on this game and the race doesn't start for me. I know this because the other people in the lobby keep screaming at each other that they someone rammed into someone else and he had to lose his front wing, etc. So, I decide to quit and rejoin the hopper. I have no idea how but the hopper shows that I finished second and scored 18 points. As I rejoined the hopper, the other guys got furious at me and started abusing me and questioning me as to how I scored 18 points when I left the lobby and kicked me from the game. What a horrible experience that was. I still haven't come around to playing one single multiplayer game. What a shame!  As to the Championship Mode, it's a meh. I have no idea why Codemasters decided to take away the customization options as to how one approaches a weekend race, be it one shot quali, short weekend or the full weekend experience. All that is gone now and you are left with no choice to play the game by their rules. Such a fail!  The quick race mode is nothing new. Just play a boring single race and come back to the home screen. Not much improvement other than that.  I haven't played the pro-season mode yet and I don't feel like I should be playing it either as you won't have any sort of assists and camera customization options and since I use a keyboard and not a racing wheel, it is almost impossible to control the oversteer on the cars in this game without traction control cranked to full. This is another one of those meh issues in the game.  The graphics are great but the optimization for the PC is terrible. TERRIBLE! This could've been done so much more better. There are also just so many bugs in the game, it just takes away the enjoyment of racing an F1 car. The pit-lane graphics and sounds are just horrible and there are sudden framerate drops all over. There is nothing we can do but hope that the Codies fix this stuff in the coming patches.  If you are really interested in F1 and want to immerse youself in an experience which is enjoyable as well as challenging, I suggest you buy the F1 2010 or 2013 game(s). These guys are just taking more stuff away with every iteration of the game.",-1,0

At the time of writing I've put 100+ hours into 3 characters, and it was mostly worth it. A few frustrations keep this from being a 10/10 game but it's certainly worthy of at least an 8.

I started playing these at about five and now at eighteen me and my twenty five year old sister went back and bought all of the Freddi Fish games. If you're like me and grew up with them then you alrady know that these are the best kids games around to date. They taught problem solving skills and good morals without ever making it seem like work. All the games share a common lay out and a cast of memorable characters that children can really get into. I not only highly recomend these but also highly recomend the entire Humongous Entertainment collection. It's nostalgia at its best for us 'older kids' and it's good clean fun for young children that will keep them comming back for hours on end.  P.S. all the Humongous Enternainment package games sport at least two different versions of their stories, one common one and one rare one. It just makes them even more fun...that and the fact that you can quite literally click on anything for a funny result.",1,0

243470,Watch_Dogs,"After playing a few hours, I have to admit that the game can be quite addicting to explore the open world with your hacking skills! It's something never seen before in a sandbox game and makes the game really unique. And off course like every sand box game it has it's bugs and glitches, i had some moments where the game would freeze for a second or two while driving or that the frames would drop for no reason (this only occured once for now) but that doensn't mean that the game is bad! Wish the driving mechanics were better but overall the game is really enjoyable. You truly feel like a bad ♥♥♥ when you walk the streets with that smartphone in your hand and that you can use the city as as a weapon!! There was this one time while i was being persued by the cops... i was nearby the trainstation and was able to hack the train and force it to stop. Then i entered the train and enabled it back to continue it's route while the cops were hopelessly watching me escape. It's because of these awesoe moments that the game really stands out!!! As for the online multiplayer which let's other people invade your game is really something else and brings this fresh element that spices things up a bit. So i would definitely recommend the game!!! Don't know why some people give these negative reviews here?!! If you're having crashes update your drivers, does your pc meet the recommended system requirements? And if you're still experiencing issues just wait for ubisoft to bring updates but don't write a negative review just because you can't run the game or are having framed drops, crashes,...",1,0

The DLC's are great (except Dead Money) and even though the map itself is not huge, there is so much to explore in it that you won't notice. I've played through it 5 times on Xbox 360 and working on PC at the moment.   Skill and leveling up is similar to Skyrim and identical to Fallout 3 other than the fact that you only get to choose a perk every second level. There is a difficulty setting for everybody and the Hardcore mode is also fun if you like more realistic game play. Combat is fun and strategic if not a little dated. Somewhat unstable with mods installed but otherwise fairly solid. This game is not hard to run and is very rewarding if you're willing to explore the open world.

Its a great game to play casually and although it has a competitive game mode, you can determine the pace of each game.   To be completley honest to have the most fun out of this game, it is imperative that you play with friends. Of course you can play with people online that you dont know, but the majority of the fun in this game is playing with your friends.

9200,RAGE,"'RAGE' is id Software's newest shooter. It's about a guy (the player) who wakes up in an 'ark' years after an asteroid hits Earth and tears humanity a new one. So, as to be expected, the world is now much more Mad Max-ish. If you're expecting a story on par with the 'Fallout' games, you might be disappointed. There's not much of a story in 'RAGE', but what story there is isn't bad. Although, it does seem a little similar to 'Fallout 3'. The gameplay itself, though, feels more like 'Borderlands' than 'Fallout 3'. Especially the vehicular combat. However, 'RAGE' doesn't have a bajillion guns like 'Borderlands' does. There's only a few guns, but it is possible to craft some other weapons like remote controlled bombs, and wingsticks. The wingsticks are like metal boomerangs. They're fun to use, but maybe a little overpowered. The best thing about 'RAGE', and what makes it fun, is the combat and level design. If you're looking for a fun and challenging shooter, you should give 'RAGE' a try.",1,0

Let me start off by saying that I rarely ever sit through a game, I have a very short attention span, but I found myself constantly grinding out wave after wave thanks to the fun gameplay, great graphics, and fun soundtrack! The dialogue between the bug butcher and the scientist is really funny, a nice touch of course. The game play is super easy to get the hang of and there is a degree of skill to be achieved while playing (knowing when to use powerups and so forth). This really is a great game if you're into this genre and I would deffo recommend it! The Devs are very active in the community and they role out updates often to fix issues players are having (though I didn't run into a single one playing it all yesterday, minus the achievement bug, but that's fixed with the new update and I got all my achievements when launching the game yusss).

Even after you get guns, you can feel they're not the main focus of how the game wants you to deal with enemies. The plot is solid, but does adhere to a few dystopian-future tropes.  A good game.

92100,DETOUR,"Neat idea with poor execution. This game could be a lot of fun, but I'm still trying to figure out if the developers have even tried playing the game. The interface is clunky. Hot keys change your selection but don't take action. For instance you use WASD to move your view around the map and one of the most important tools, sensor sweep, is mapped to F2. Makes sense - your fingers are already in that general vicinty, however pressing F2 doesn't do the sensor sweep, it just makes the sensor sweep the selected action. You then have to hit the enter key which is clear across the keyboard from F2.   For single player, the first real mission after training is, as far as i can tell, unbeatable. AI opponents with no truck goals will target you, even if you also have no goals, over the AI opponent who is about to win. I tried several different strategies to foil the AI, including not completing my final road segment until a truck just needs that last segment; still no good. Learned all of the hot keys (such as they are) and the speedup still wasn't enough. I outspend all of the AIs, I nuke the AIs whenever I can... doesn't matter. There are 3 of them and one of you. There are a bunch more single player missions after that, but I've not seen them. The single player is just broken.  For multiplayer... my son and I played a few games, and while it was a little fun, the turret balance is completely off. Offensive turrets fire too fast and have too much health. They aren't taken out with a nuke and they can destroy roads as fast as you can build them. Defensive turrets are way too weak to be effective and the game quickly becomes an offensive turret race. It's cute for a little while, but quickly becomes boring.  I don't feel ripped off, I had about 1 hour of fun and the game was incredibly inexpensive; I am disappointed that a laundry list of seemingly simple and obvious improvements are still missing that could make this a reasonably fun game.",-1,0
394360,Hearts of Iron IV,"A great game, if much simplified from previous HOI titles, at least the UI is better. The biggest problem is the terrible AI. If all countries were played by players it would play out similar to World War 2, but as it is now the AI flops about doing nothing, or making stupid decisions that make no sense, like moving units away from critical front lines or declaring war on countries it can't fight. I really want to rate this positively but in its current state it's just like beta software.",-1,0

291480,Warface,"The game isn't bad, gameplay wise. It's probably the best out of every shooter i played.  Good: There is somth about it that's so satisfying, it's like all shooter combined in one game made in the best way possible. It's a twitch shooter, but it is also very tactical, which i absolutely love. It's this mix that makes it special. I love being able to shoot-and-run-instant-respawn in a small map, but also have the option to use tactics, such as placing a claymore at a choke point or at a hallway to prevent enemy from coming at you, healing after i get shot, picking the best spot, and shooting other people from behind while sneaking in order to minimize death count, with a silenced smg. I have not experienced this in other games. I play COD CS:GO BF4,3 Hardline beta etc. (your prolly thinking hey that's in every shooter ever made, dud, but it was way more usable and satisfying. It has more substance if u know what i mean. It's just the way i feel i guess)   Real time switching of accessories is amazing. Say i have an assault rifle and have 3 different optics to chose from long range to short range and you can switch between them depending where your enemy is at, Crysis style. This game will satisfy your uniqe weapon accessory itch, as it has meny of them.   Guns have a great feel and weight to them, nice sound, and that woosh ffffsssss from a high rpm silenced smg never gets old. Great graphics and sound for a fast paced shooter. The ce engine holds up nicely. No complains. I did have a glitches with my graphics, but switched the drivers to stable release and went away (amd r9 280x 14.4) &lt;- if u get glitch switch to stable driver 14.4  CONTROLS ARE AMAZING. They completely nailed the controls. I mean the way you move around and mouse movement. It doesn't have any weight.. if u know what i mean, like in bf3,4.. the difference is huge and what kept me playing untill:  Bad:  The F2P model is not good at all, and certain items you get make the game so unbalanced, it just doesn't make sense.   After i reached a certain rank, i could not play in the 'rookie' channel anymore(where there are servers made by new ppl). I am forced to play with the 'Pro' chanel. Where basically ... you got it.. i'ts channel where the top players play. They have all the cool ♥♥♥♥ you can think of. from bullet proof vest that take 3 magazine to kill and can resist grenades and claymores (all exploding same time). to automatic shotguns, one hit kill sniper, etc.  The player count is too low. I mean, you will not be used to this. I doub't there are even 100 people playing. That's like a server in some other games lol. There are three channels Rookie Experienced and Pro. After you done with rookie, you go straight to pro because there are 0 people playing in Experienced (which would have been the second step for me).  The difference is that in rookie channels, all the people there are new or trying out the game. They will be very bad at playing and certainly do not have the best gear(they don't care enought to buy weapons) and when you go to Pro channel, all the poeple playing are very serious about the game and have cool gear, which they bought or unlocked. I am not trying to blame on P2W model, but these 'two groups' of players are extremely different.  After u done with rookie best thing to do is open a new account and start playing rookie again...  When i was playing in rookie I was thinking, wtf are these people giving negative reviews, P2W and all... I never spent money and was getting 35+ kills and 10 deaths every match. Was having a blast, Top of the leaderboard every game...  I think this game needs more players to be better to minimize the disparity of certain group skills. It needs to be more defused. E.G Allow other higher ranked players to join with lower rank players. You can not force them to play at a certain way!! The game has massive potential.  I'll keep an eye on this...",-1,0

405900,Disgaea PC,"Edit: Update has rolled out and fixed a couple of them problems!  This seems to be Nippon Ichi's first real foot in the door to PC Gaming. So, of course, there are bound to be problems with the first release ( as customary with some older companies trying to jump into the PC porting game).  The game itself is a joy. If you are a fan of games like Fire Emblem or Final Fantasy Tactics and can handle a few humorous anime tropes, I am sure you will feel right at home with this game. However, I personally see it ( at this stage atleast) as a journey you are taking with a dev testing the waters on pc. The game right now, is having a few issues ( as of 2/26/2016) with things pertaining to performance and things of that nature. You aren't garunteed to have these issues but it is somewhat of a risk you are taking when purchasing the game.   ( I will give them credit, they appear to be actively working to solve the problems. Check their posts in the community hub for progress on that)  I do, however, recommend you buy the game. Either now, if you are willing to brave the storms of a first time port, or later when all of the issues are settled.   Either way, I am going to go ahead and give them a thumbs up in good faith that they will solve the problems.",1,0

There are different modes: Puzzle gives you challenges that can be timed or based on getting a certain number of combos. Battle (my personal favorite) has you and an opponent making combos that send monsters to attack the other player's HP. IQ gives you puzzles where you have to clear the screen of blocks. These modes all have multiple difficulty settings, so players of all skill levels can enjoy them. I play most games singleplayer, so I can't comment on the multiplayer experience.

Stunning graphics, a strong and heartwrenching story that had me at the edge of my seat, a gorgeous soundtrack that sounded like angels singing to me, and amazing character development. I can't go much longer without mentioning how the character relationships were handled. At first I thought they were going to slap together two characters and call it a ship, but this gift from God didn't go down that route. You can really see the bonds and friendships between the rats as they work together to defeat their enemy, the cat. Several moments of the game made me cry, especially the bad endings, where the rats end up dying.  This game isn't worth this small amount of cash. It's worth way more. It's so surprising that there are even bad reviews here, because this game is a revolutionary masterpiece. I can now understand where all the hype is coming from.  I heard that there was a Bad Rats anime coming eventually, too! Although, of course, it could never match up to the beauty of the game.  Tractor Rat x Batter Rat is my OTP. Fight me, Batter x Bomber shippers.  Overall, I give it a 9/10. It's okay.",1,1

291650,Pillars of Eternity,"Obsidian may have just hit their stride with this one. I have always had a distaste for this company... I did give them credit for both NWN2 and Dungeon siege 3; everything they created pre-pillars has been either a lackluster bank off of a highly successful GotY title, or just a buggy, lifeless mess or both. They might have made me fall in love with them... making all mistakes of the past nonexistant.  Pillars is the love letter to all dnd styled old school crpgs. Though it lacks the ability to pretty much... do what ever you like, 'multiple options for interaction via ring menu', it still has the proper substance of said CRPGs.   So far, The story is pretty intriguing, and the way it is delivered is through three elements...(main game story quests delivering in game cutscene sequences, Storybook Cutscenes with options to act based on your stats, and through truely fleshed out character development.)   The world so far is full of life and definitly has a story to tell. Character customization, though limited does show depth. the dialogue is Voice Acted!!!! unlike most dnd games, we can just kick back and listen, but there is a glitch that has ruined this for me, so i have to play the game the traditional way by reading(muting the audio via the mixer). The positives go on and on.  some negatives... Theres a few glitches, one persisting one being the quest message close sfx gets stuck on loop when you close a message sometimes. if this happens... its going to happen for the rest of your playthrough possibly. restartig the game does not fix it. This glitch ruins the wonderful voice actng. theres limited interaction when ompared to classic dnd crpgs. the bonus content that is suppose to come with the champion edition is incomplete with promise of being provided when completed... That was a sad discovery when I went into the documentry folder :( . thats about it so far.  Bravo obsidian... I love you now :3. ~Mike.M  *Fun Factoid, This was made with unity, extra points! kidding. one thing that does give this game extra points though is that its a completely original Story!!!! its not a dnd story.",1,0

48240,Anno 2070,"First off.... Uplay. I know, I know, it's a pain in the ♥♥♥, but it's mostly because Steam doesn't bother to update it (with good reason). The updates made by the launcher itself dont work, which means that you just have to download uplay off of Ubisoft. A 3 minute effort for hours of fun with a really nice game.  Dont listen to the negative reviews my friends, please, Uplay isn't that much of a hassle, and definitely shouldn't hinder your decision to buy.  Anno Anno Anno.  I loved the game. It's just hilariously fun to build up your island as a tycoon or tech and then decide you want to nuke everyone else. Loved those aspects of it. City building is fun and difficult, ensuring an interesting experience, and campaign seems quite entertaining too. The lore, which I have not really gone into much lately, is interesting on the surface, and I especially like the conflict between Tech, Tycoon, and Eco.  Combat is interesting, with each faction sporting strengths and weaknesses, and I LOVE the whole submarine side of it, really recommend the DLC and all.  Diplomacy is OK, but I've only scratched the surface and all, since I'm currently sanctioned by, let's check, every single faction on the map, because of my avid use of nuclear warheads. The islands I conquer are currently glass, but I think that I can monopolize on the cathedral building business.  10/10 Would play again  ",1,0

327670,Ironcast,"This game is like a combination of Puzzle Quest and FTL. You've got inventory and leveling up, and in the gameplay there's matching game with resource management to attack/defend/use abilities. On top of this there's random missions each in-game 'day', with each mission taking up that entire day and then after you complete it you move on to the next. Every mission gives you currency, experience, and blueprints you can use to purchase new equipment for your mech. After 10 days a boss shows up in London and you have to fight it.  All of that seems like it would work well, but it's all tweaked too far on the 'nearly impossible' side. At the base level you have to complete missions to get stronger, but the drops after each mission are random so you could go for a while without getting a weapon or other equipment that will be enough of an upgrade to justify the significant cost to purchase it. Every time you level up the abilities it offers you to select from are random, so you could go for a while without getting any that are useful in more than the most situational of situations. The matching gameplay ends up like how it sometimes happens in Puzzle Quest, where on occasion you might end up without any gems of the resource you need and so aren't able to win not because of lack of skill, but because the RNG says 'nope'. And then you have to do all this preparation in 10 days. Like, imagine FTL if you had to fight the rebel mothership at the end of sector 2. That's how tight the timing has to be on everything.   After each failed attempt you gain experience towards a global profile level that unlocks bonuses that apply to each run. These bonuses are almost entirely useless on their own, however. Things like getting an additional +5 health per level up, when the default health for your Ironcasts are in the 800s and by the end of the game enemy weapons are doing around 180 damage per hit. The only way these global bonuses would help is if many, many, many levels were grinded out to have them add up to something significant. That's not my idea of fun.  You basically need to have perfect item drops plus perfect levelups plus perfect gem configurations in order to succeed. An ideal balance for roguelikes is to have the player's skill + strategy be able to overcome most of what randomness is thrown at them. This game is too far on the random side, to the point where player skill is almost meaningless. If you don't get the right drops or have enough global bonuses to boost you up, you won't stand a chance regardless of how perfectly you execute on your strategies.  It's really a shame, because the game looks fantastic and the setting is quite fun. If it were tweaked a little more fairly it would be quite an enjoyable experience.",-1,0

214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,"Vanilla Rome 2 was pretty awful and unenjoyable compared to its predeccesors. I'm happy to say that with all the patches and Emperor Edition, the game is now actually pretty fun without mods. If you still have buyer's remorse, it's worth trying the game again to finally get your money's worth.  One of the biggest improvements is the better AI and combat. On release the AI was incredibly stupid and battles ended far too quickly - this is no longer the case. The AI is now far more tactical and battles take much longer, akin to previous Total War games.   Some other improvements have been made upon previously confusing and difficult to understand concepts like the building chains and the politics system. Buildings have been streamlined so they're now easier to understand and you have some vague idea of what to build. The politics system has been revamped so it now provides tangible benefits to the player instead of just being a countdown to inevitable civil war.   Unfortunately some fan favourites like pre-battle speeches, avatar conquest or family trees still aren't in it, but with all the work CA has put in over the last year the game is now fun. It's irritating that we didn't get a game like this at release, but it's definitely appreciated that CA devoted as much time and resources to the game as they have over the year to bring it up to the standard we'd expect.",1,0

360130,,"It'd be a cheap fun little game if it wasn't that underdeveloped, it feels like a proof-of-the-concept. It's could be excusable for 1 buck game. There is campaign mode, duel and surival modes which can be playable by one or two local players. Which seems like a lot of bang for a buck, but it's not. The main issues are:  1) Serious lack of variety in gameplay. It's core mechanic is very enjoyable and easy pick up yet hard to master, but there isn't anything else to add any depth. It's a game of two buttons... and a single trick. Even bosses are the same enemies but big, so boss fights are exactly the same as any other fight. Campaign consist of four chapters, each chapter is devided into dozens of fights, but actually can be beaten in 20 minutes, thus drawing campaign as 2 hours of extremely repetitive action which you might be bored even before you beat the first chapter. Local co-op as always saves the day by some degree. You all know how even terrible games are kinda fun when played with friend, humans are social beings. And it's not even a bad game. But this is also where the next problem is:  2) Controller works only in-game, you constantly need keyboard to use menus. It diminishes local co-op because it's basically removing 'couch' from 'couch multiplayer'. I dunno if there is anyone who likes to play local coop in the office or on notebooks... maybe there is, but it's not me. Also there is a launcher for settings instead of proper in-game menus, yeap standard Unity engine launcher that a lot of commercial games remove as soon as there is proper options implemented. It works, but, as always, it means devs didn't bother to tune their game for seamless experience on PC. Yea, and the game doesn't allow for any analog axes to be mapped.  On the side note, there is some problems with achievements, and lack of trading cards. I personally can't care less about both, but some people might find it dissappointing. The game is great foundation to be expanded upon, too bad developer hasn't put more effort into actually building anything worth buying. And moreover absolutely abandoned it.  p.s.: Sorry for broken english, not my main tongue.",-1,1

I can say that this game is probably one of the best TD games I've played, so far, there's a story in it, heroes leave their young to defend the castle, something breaks, all hell breaks loose and they have to defend the crystals  The gameplay is fun, set up your towers and then go off to do some killing of your own or just don't set up any towers and take on the horde yourself. There's plenty of equipment and pets to obtain and there's four classes (soon to be five or six) to max out. With the ability to spec your hero, you can spec them in any way you feel like, so you can have a Tower Squire and a DPS Monk for example.  The graphics are kind of awesome, despite being all cartoony, there's a certain charm to it, and the lighting effects in some places are rather pretty, although distracting.  There's plenty to do, there's four difficulty levels, four/five/six different heroes, challenges and so on!",1,0
218680,Scribblenauts Unlimited,"Waited to buy this one till it became a daily deal. What a waste... of waiting! Seriously, this game is so much fun to get creative with. It's the epitome of casual, as it never gets difficult, but there's weeks to be lost just messing around. Give your character any color moustache or spawn a cowboy hat and make it giant. Spawn a velociraptor in a crowded downtown area... and reset the level since that's not a good idea. Anyway, buy this, it's fun as heck.",1,0

The gameplay is deceivingly deep, the mechanics with attack types and defense types are extremely interesting, the cooldown based system of units, spells and trigger cards are brilliant game design. The campaign, although lacking in story is full of innovative missions, with three levels of difficulty for each with better rewards the higher you climb. The grind for cards is almost non-existant thanks to the gold, ruby and diamond system. If you need a certain card rarity, no problem, just take out your wallet.  If you are playing other card games, you are missing out on Epic Cards Battle(TCG).",1,1

Many negative reviewers have said that because they are 'depressed' they cannot pick the options that they said would make them less depressed, ans so succeed at 'completing' the game. Depression is exactly that, it's a spiral of downward thoughts and negative emotions, it is meant to seem like you can never break away and make yourself 'better'. This game captures that very well, you have to be intuitive and engineer your own way out, not the easy option, but the realistic one that suits your mental state.  I have never had depression and hope i never do, but this game might have given me an insight on how that mind set may come about and how damaging and comsming to life and social interactions it may be.  I don't know how accurate this game is at portaying how it is to live with depression, however it was an enjoyable play and is quite short, a bit less than 1 hour.",1,0
342180,Arizona Sunshine,"Apparently, the devs of this game decided to grant exclusive access to content for players with i7 processors.

Before I discovered that fact, I played this game for about an hour and a half. 45 minutes of that time was trying to figure out which ports to forward in order to make multiplayer work, 30 minutes of that was loading the level, and 15 minutes of that was actually playing the game.

Dialogue, descriptions, and the mechanics of their delivery. Some people may not enjoy this much text, but I delight in it. At this point I am 8.5 hours into the game, and I cannot get enough. In addition to the writing, combat is also enjoyable. I'm not a power-player so my builds may not be efficient, but I appreciate the game allowing me to develop my character the way I see fit in terms of role-playing, and still have fun fighting. Once I am done with the campaign, I will be sure to check out the authoring tools. At this stage I might just be inspired to try creating a story of my own.",1,0

The intro is the number one intro visually and every way. It has a really crazy feel to it without feeling off base with the rest of the game. It's funny but I can take it serious both at the same time. The game is super immersive even in it's own hallucinatory wilderness of a setting.  I hope the game gets a bigger following so the multiplayer can grow into it's own. I can imagine it will be fun with so many characters and play styles.",1,0

248820,Risk of Rain,"Risk of Rain is an addicting and fun to play sort of beat-em up RPG which takes on some rouge-like qualities. The basic gameplay is killing seemingly randomly spawned enemies to acquire new items to become stronger and beat bosses until you progress to the final stage. This game has a story that while not the most prominent of features is still interesting in terms of lore. The items and monsters you come accross get catalogued and have individual descriptions which builds a somewhat deep world for the game to take place in. As you play the game more items and characters to play become unlocked. Unlockables are extremely motivating although some of them can be a bit difficult on normal mode and playing on easy mode is such a tremendous gap of difficulty that it sometimes makes the player feel cheated when choosing it. One of the reasons is that the separate difficulties directly effect the difficulty curve in the game. As you play the game automatically gets harder after set intervals. This is a unique and a well-done risk against reward mechanic, but I feel easy mode may make dilute it too much.  Risk of Rain's main gameplay is quite rewarding. As the initial starting class you can roll out of enemy danger-zones and shoot from afar. Many of the unlocked characters have their own unique gameplay style which can become quite interesting during multiplayer. Though some of the characters feel marginally less fun to play than others. On occasion a player may find themselves with a slow first level because the enemy spawing is quite sparatic initially. This can often lead to poor chance at later progression automatically. At the end of each level there is a boss fight which can range from very difficult to downright child's play. Sometimes bosses will spawn on a platfrom that the player can shoot from but the boss can't attack from. The boss fights are almost always exciting though and the boss and enemy variety throughout the game is large enough to where traversing the levels is seldom boring.  Overall, Risk of Rain is a fun game with rewarding gameplay. If you have friends to play the game gets even better. Some of the unlockables can be a bit tough, but easy mode will allow for smooth travels while unlocking new items and classes.  Risk of Rain receives 5 large potatoes out of 7.",1,0

311340,METAL GEAR SOLID V: GROUND ZEROES,"I purchased this game when it was 13.99$ on sale.  For the amount I paid, I was pretty satisfied with the game.  The controls took a bit of getting used to, they're different from previous Metal Gear games, and its much easier to be spotted in this game than in previous ones. As a demo, this is a great sample of what to expect in the full game, but I can't help but feel a tiny bit burned by having to pay for this.  Lets face facts: The main meat of this game is the main story mission, which doesn't take very long to complete. The side missions (while fun) are all on the same map as the main mission which leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Most of them seem like they were thrown together in order to justify selling the demo.  I've enjoyed my time playing the game though, thats for sure. I'm very much looking forward to the full release.  If you're a fan of MGS, I would definitely recommend picking it up (when its on sale).",1,0

Gold grinding, micro-management and position control of heroes on the battlefield. It's against tower defense spirit.  This game designed with reducing difficulty over time concept. If you stuck, just grind some gold, buy new runes and you will pass a level without difficulty. While I believe this is not bad by itself, grid spoiled it.  Another flaw for me is a concept of 1 heros for 1 mob type. It leads to lack of diversity. Each hero has huge bonuses to certain mob types. Hero talant tree looks shallow for me.

356040,Sheltered,"To me anything that keeps my attention at $1/hr is totally worth it. What I really liked about this game is that it has a very Oregon Trail feel to it and it's all human interactions. I like the story you can develop for your characters and such and the game is relatively intuitive. There were just a few parts that took a while to realize.  1. Feed your pets all the time, too many times while speeding up time my pet would die, kind of sucks.  2. Keep an eye on the health status of your people by cycling through, there were times when someone would die because they didn't get better even though I gave them the appropriate medicine.  3. There are arrow buttons, lol. For a while I didn't notice I could cycle through people to send out on an expedition.   Other than that game is awesome. Easy to get sucked into it.

34830,Sniper: Ghost Warrior,"At first I thought this wasn't such a bad game. Not as bad as people made it out to be at least. I usually play games with an open mind. I don't want people to tell me which games are great and which games are not. If I had listened to these people I would've missed out on some pretty cool games. So, I started playing Sniper Ghost Warrior. First impressions; graphics are solid, gameplay as well. It reminded me of Sniper Elite, but set in the jungle. That was the first level. After a few levels, the AI started to get indecisive; at times hardly noticing you, and other times seeing you pretty much instantly, even when in cover. So the stealth aspect just wasn't there anymore, which is a shame because sneaking around and shooting people in slowmotion looked and felt great. Later levels also introduced run-and-gun aspects which just didn't fit the game. It didn't feel right and it didn't play right and should've been removed altogether. Let's just hope SGW 2 improves on most (all?) fronts.  [Rating: 61/100]",-1,0

307780,Mortal Kombat X,"ugh... it really PAINS me to have to give Mortal Kombat X a thumbs down it really does but I cannot in good conscience recommend this game at full price. it's not to say this is a bad game, on the contrary it's my personal favorite in the whole series but the greed of these developers nowadays is really starting to ♥♥♥♥ me off cause it really just holding the game back. but we will get into all of that in a little bit… let's start off with the good...   first off let me just say what a great game this is and that it is hands down my personal favorite mortal kombat game to date. i've enjoyed the living crap out of this game so far and i look forward to playing it even more in the future. the game's graphics are just gorgeous looking, the kombat itself is so smooth and fluent and the blood and gore is just horrifically gruesome and i just love every bit of it!!! it really feels like a next gen mortal kombat game. the main story of the game is a bit on the short side but it is still one hell of a ride. there's a total of 12 chapters and a total of around 50 fights, the story is told through beautifully crafted, long cinematic cutscenes in between each fight. the story is full of suspense and twist and an epic cliffhanger at the end making the wait for the next Mortal Kombat game that much more harder for me lol. in total it took me around 4 to 5 hours to beat it. as far as single player goes there is also challenge towers to complete, test your luck and an excellent training mode for beginners adding tons of hours of gameplay. there's also an extensive online mode to fight others in with factions wars and online leader boards and even “living towers” that are like challenge towers that changes daily and weekly adding even more fun. on the surfaces the game is excellent and is probably one of the best MKs in the franchise. there is certainly a wealth of stuff to do in this game and you will have a blast while doing it… but now it's time for the bad… and oh boy...   sadly Mortal Kombat X is littered with crappy and meaningless DLC. things like “easy fatalities” and crap cheap charters skins that look like they should've already been in the game to start with *cough* *cough* blue steel sub zero *cough* *cough* and just a pure lack of content compared to MK9. to start off with MKX has only 24 characters on disk (not counting goro sinces he is technically DLC) compared to MK9s 27 starting character roster. also some characters such as rain, sindel and baraka are present in the game with full move sets and everything but are not playable, its even been proven they could be threw mods. they most likely did it to put them as separate DLC you will have to pay for down the line just like tanya… i don't have a problem with DLC characters but paying for characters that are already in our game is just stupid, looking at you goro… also they gimped the krypt so you would be more likely to buy there 'unlock everything” DLC. for those of you who don't know the krypt is a place where you can go to spend koins you have earned in the game to buy things such as new costumes for fighters and fatalities and brutalitys and a whole bunch of cool stuff to unlock and use in game. in MK9 it was really fun and cool to earn koins and unlock everything. here even in MKX they made you feel more involved with it by making it its own fun first person metagame you can play to unlock stuff. the problem with it in MKX is that they severely gimped koin earring big time... by the time i beat the campain of the game i had around 67,000 koins. sounds pretty good right? well in the new krypt i spent all of that within around 5 minutes and only unlocked a hand full of items… so over 5 hours of gameplay and i barely got jack sh*t... the average item now can cost any where from a 1000 to almost 10,000 koins and you earn koins at a much slower rate than mk9 so in other words it's practically impossible to unlock everything in the krypt without grinding away for weeks on end unless you buy the 'unlock everything in the krypt pack DLC' for 20 bucks… which is a HUGE load of crap... i could go on all day but my point is if you pay $60 bucks for a new game like this i expect the DLC for the game to be legitimate downloadable content that adds on to my game, not this petty bullsh*t “free to play” style DLC that is borderline meaningless and at times feels like it gimps your game. this type of dirty business practices is really starting to sicken me and it needs to stop...   well now that all of that is out of my system it's time to wrap this up, overall Mortal Kombat X is a FANTASTIC game but its only flaw is that it's heavily pledged by greed. but if you can get this game on sale like i did off bundle star it's certainly worth it and you won't regret it, but i just can not recommend this game at full price with this kind of DLC, you're better off waiting for a sale and then buying its DLC with the money you saved so you can have the whole Mortal Kombat X experience. it's a great game but with a lot of bad business practices…   Overall Score: (9/10) Incredible ;3 *but plague with god awful dlc :c*",-1,0

230230,Divinity: Original Sin (Classic),"I really tried to like this game. The character customization and development seemed really cool. The group-based tactical combat and inter-group dialouge was also very intriguing. I could not get past the heavy roleplaying and book-long text dialouge you have with ever character you encounter, even minor ones. I found myself board with the bland and generic story and skippin along through the dialogue. Eventually I lost interest in the linear gameplay and overall regret purchasing the game, even at 40% off.

381210,Dead by Daylight,"  I was excited about the game, and hoped for something good actually. So free weekend came on, and I immediately had to download it and see how it actually is. So my first experience:  I launched the game, and the Menu in general looks nice. Then I customized my characters looks, and try to understand the HUD a bit and different options/perks they had. I'm about to join a lobby and went waiting ... and waiting ... and waiting ... and finally I joined someone's lobby. Then someone left, and someone joined. Then they all left, and had to reconnect again to another lobby. Then in another lobby that I just recently joined, the host left. Then I had to reconnect again and again and again ...  Then (Finally) a game started and found a decent lobby but no, the loading screen took like 15 minutes so I restarted the game. Then finally I started to play the game after so many tries, and some exploiter killer, kills everyone and the game ended in 15 seconds. And at that moment, I had no words for it but just to uninstall it.  It really disappoints me how I thought it was a decent game, which actually is just a piece of crap that I would never spend my money on, They don't even have a anti-cheat program or a decent server that connecting through lobbies goes smoothly like other games. I wasted like 30 minutes to find 1 lobby that ended in 15 seconds, and no .. I didn't just try 1 round, like 3 rounds. I feel sorry for the people that actually bought this game.  So a 0/10 for me.

The game is well built and the ui is easy to navigate for the most part, I myself only ran into some troubles when trying to pick new skills for characters but once figured out there are no issues. The Tutorial is simply great and allows you to get to know the game and explains everything extremely well. Gameplay is solid and certainly different than other games, which is a big plus. See it as a bit of settlers of catan, where you need to earn resources in order to win the game. Tie this in with a bit of D&amp;D and you get this game.  I PERSONALLY got tired of the game pretty quickly, this is because I am not a completionist, once I have seen something once I have little desire to visit it again, so if you are like me consider waiting for a sale as the full price might not be worth it. The game CAN be completed in as little as an hour to a couple of hours depending on the difficulty you set it on. There are about 8 'Maps' that you can play on and without the DLC that adds 2 more there is not a lot of variance in the game. The only variance is the different runs you do on the same maps over and over by only changing characters, this is what I didnt enjoy myself. If you are someone that likes to collect achievements, unlock all of the characters or visist 100% of evey map I can easily tell you that over 100 hours of fun await you in this game.   TLDR:  In the end I would definately recommend this game, If you are someone that doesnt like replaying games wait for a sale, are you a completionist this game is an absolute steal even for its current price.",1,1

It's a lazy build on a very similar graphics engine to that of SR3, and is worth your money only if its on sale.  Verdict: 5/10",-1,1

224260,No More Room in Hell,"This is a slow, terrible and cumbersome first person shooter mod for Half Life 2 that feels like a hardcore version of Left 4 Dead. Your multiplayer co-op party needs to carry out objectives in maps and mostly just stay alive. Its pretty easy to stay alive and not die, but its difficult to do anything else. First of all, the game is pretty slow. I mean the animations of your character are slow. When you switch to a flash light, it is always off to start with, then you need to turn it on.... WITH BOTH HANDS! Watch as your character slowly turns on a flashlight with his left hand while holding it with his right. Then there's the inventory system that has a good use of space management. The catch is that you really can't hold all that much. Your ammo takes up space, which is logical, its just I can't imagine when it comes down to carrying a sledge hammer, flashlight and a rifle that you can't carry all three at once.  You walk pretty slow (there is a sprint button), which is okay, but you swing pretty slow and the zombies shuffle their way toward you. Oh and when you get bitten, its like a poison that will slowly drain your health until you're dead. Once you're dead, your character becomes a zombie while you spectate as a ghost. Reloading takes quite a while, but maybe other video games have spoiled me into reloading fast when the reality is that it takes a while.  Carrying things is a chore, don't drop a key next to a door, because you'll never be able to pinpoint the key on the ground from the door. Maps have invisible walls preventing exploration, even when it looks like there is exploration.  Another downside is, this isn't really a campaign, its just more of a series of multi player co-op maps. Left 4 Dead is just better. There's a reason why this took 2 years to make it to Steam. Its just a cumbersome game and maybe that adds to the survival horror aspect, but eh its not for me. This isn't an action game, its a slow beast walking toward you when you can't reload your rifle fast enough.",-1,0

272060,Serena,"I'm warning you now this contains spoilers. This is for you sake more than it is mine, because I'm saving you an hour of your time. So this game started oit incredibly weak, then built it's way up. I started to geuinely enjoy it. There were mysteries to be solved. It gave you just enough information to begin piecing things together, but not so much that you had your answer. You play as a writer, name not given, as he patiently awaits his wife at the cabin. The thing that kept me playing was the thing where he would talk about patiently awaiting the love of his life, and occasionally break off into how he missed her so much... How he'd do anything to see her again but realistically knew it couldn't happen. It reminded me a lot of Silent Hill 2, and as a very avid fan of the orignal Silent Hill games, it gave me a damn good feeling. Another thing I enjoyed was the fact that after a while, all this untapped love and immense amounts of nostalgia turned into bitter hate. He talks about burning her clothes, how much he hates her and how vein she is. It turns violent. Fast. Something happened between the main character and his wife Serena. They never really tell you what happens. He talks about pouring salt down her throat until she vomits. Throwing entire bookshelves into the damn lake. You hear the voice of Serena once you look at certain objects; going from sweet and loving to angry and hate filled. Now, before long, after finding a jewelry box in a trunk and setting it down on the wooden table, you have to go to the ama- amair- dammit I don't speak French. You go to the big old dresser right next to the bed and there's a dead body. By the way, Mr. 'I'm a writer so I have to use unnecesarrily big words' Goes into a horrible fit of rage earlier in the game, the likes of which are usually reserved for insulted Russians and Patrick Kane after a cab driver forgot to give him the extra $0.25 to his change from cab fare. (I wouldn't lie to you. Look it up.) So, you hear voices and there's a dude and a chick. They talk about bulldozers taking down the cabin and how the female left something in the cabin. (I thought it was the body but she said she wore it. I dont think many people can slip into a dead body like it were some type of dress.) The female voice is very obviously Serena. They then set the place on fire and the credits roll, leading to a more disappointing ending than Arkham Origins. It also leaves a lot of questions unanswered. Who was the dead body? Who was the stiff Serena was talking to? Why did they set the cabin on fire? Why didn't the main character remember anything? Why was he even in the cabin in the first place? Did Serena invite him there so she could kill him? What bulldozers? Why bulldozers? Why does the same damn spot on the floor make an ungodly amount of creaking sounds? Is there a sercret there? I'm not just being dumb and skipping over things here. I spent an entire hour exploring every possiblity in the game. These questions and more are left unasked. I'll hand it to them though. The creators did do a pretty good job of making an overall somewhat creepy atmosphere. It'd grow oddly darker for no reason. There is a picture of Serena on the table, the face is first scratched out, but before long you can see her face there. Soon, the face is scowling. Noises, whispers, voices; whenever you make some type of revelation. But besides that massive ♥♥♥♥♥ don't waste your time.",-1,0

226860,Galactic Civilizations III,"My feelings about GalCiv III are kind of mixed. Pro: it is similar to GalCiv II. Con: some mechanics of GalCiv II are IMO not acceptable in 2015.  First of all, the UI. The fleet mechanics is clumsy. It may be me, but I always make wrong moves when I move ships in our out fleets. For example, you can only eject ships from a fleet. It would be much more natural to select that you want to move away of the fleet, and just move them.  Ship construction. I'm not really interested in making pretty ships. But during the design the ship view occupies 90% of the screen. Understanding what a component does requires to hover the very small icons of the components. And it gets hard understanding which components you are moving in and out the ship. I also didn't find easy to get around all the ship designs.  More serious issue, I'm worried that - an in GalCiv II - every single mission requires to get very close to the end of the tech tree. That is, destroying shipyards and space stations require a lot of firepower, that you get quite late in the game. That's the sensation I got after playing the tutorial, so I may be wrong. While in games like Civ V you can conquer other civilizations at every stage of the game.  The game also has bugs here and there at this moment. One annoying one is that you can't upgrade a ship that uses a strategic resource to a design that requires the same resource IF you have not any spare resource of that kind.  But for the rest the game seems very interesting and I'll spend more hours on the game, and for that reason I'll give it a thumbs up. However I really hope that Bradley &amp; Co. decide to streamline ship design and improve fleet management. ",1,0

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"TL;DR: Story overall good, but sometimes meh and confusing, villain disappointing, characters good, gameplay absolutely amazingly fantastic. Still a full recommendation due to the extreme degree of freedom you as a player have in this game.  Grandiose gameplay, astonishing freedom to approach situations, rarely a restriction that tells you 'you gotta be stealthy or else instant failure bro' (happens in 'total stealth' mode and the opening mission). Being a sneaky Snake fails? Well, just roll with it and shoot soldiers in the face. You can still complete the mission, it just might not be an S-rank anymore and be a little harder as well. The buddies are a great help - Quiet is universally helpful, the dog is the ultimate stealth companion sniffing out any enemies within 60-80m and D-Horse can get vehicles to spin out if it takes a dump on the road. Never even touched the D-Walker mecha you get later on, probably very useful for a louder approach.  The story/characters will be confusing if you haven't at least read up on the story of previous Metal Gear games. It also could use a bit more focus, espeially in the second chapter where you mostly replay old missions with added difficulties (meh!). A few story threads could have been tied up better (chapter three was axed, after all). The cassette tapes that you can listen to greatly expand the lore of the game and easily span a few hours of material.  Oh and I really was ashamed when I found out why Quiet was left half-naked by the developers. Ashamed for them. I might have bought that reasoning if she had been treated well by the game's camera, but she's reduced to eye candy and fanservice for drooling teens and pre-teens who don't have internet access way too often.  Online invasion mode is something I could really do without. Not that well implemented, often not that well balanced and riddled with connectivity issues.  Another bugbear are the development times and dispatch mission times. Weapon/Gadget development is instant at first, but later requires up to two and a half hours of time in which the game needs to be running and not paused. At least 15 of my 130+ hours were spent AFK or on the desktop, allowing development to happen while I didn't want to actively play.",1,0
307690,Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition,"+ Looks great. Plenty of detail and interesting things to see in Hong Kong. + Interesting enough plot though pretty much what you'd expect from a Hong Kong police action movie plot. Characters are well written and voice acted. + Combat system works great for melee fighting.  - Gun mechanics and missions are pretty terrible and clunky. - Driving mechanics are passable but don't feel real enough. Things can get a bit twitchy. - Map looks great and is big, but I was hoping for more alleys or things to climb on. The parkour setpieces that happen in a few missions seemed to be the only places that took advantage of the alleys and rooftops in game.  I haven't played a grand theft auto clone in quite a long time. I find it hard to keep playing them long enough to complete, but this I went through in a few days and really enjoyed it. I believe way back this was supposed to be part of the True Crime series, and it ended up getting scrapped and retooled into this. I'm glad the team it went to was able to spend the time to finish up everything properly. It seems like a lot of love and effort went into it.

If you are a content junkie, then maybe give this game a pass. However, what you see here is a PERFECT example of quality over quantity. The developers, rather than cramming extra features in, took a teeny golden nugget, concentrated and crammed all the greatness they could, and released a tiny, but shining gem. It doesn't do much, but what this game does do, is effectively perfection. What exactly makes this game so great anyway?  This game is so satisfying, so intense, so crunchy that it is hard to ever get tired of it. Additionally, the atmosphere is absolutely amazing. Get chills down your spine as you see flocks of demons and devils swarming towards you, as you hear their heavy breathing getting louder and louder. The difficulty here is beautiful. Beads of sweat will dot your face as you frantically jump about and slaughter everything facing you. You will close the game panting and thinking 'h-h-oly...' chug an energy drink and play this, and the power you'll feel is insane.  Something you hear too many games boast about is 'fast paced classic fps action!! Just like doom and quake!! THROWBACK!!!' And then they were lying, as the game reaks of modern slow-paced boredom. But no-this game is a TRUE testament to the original days of quake. It is strongly reminiscent. Overall, as long as you're fine with minimal content, this is a game that energy-junkies and gothic theme-enjoyers will absolutely adore. Totally worth the asking price, and you likely will not regret it.",1,0
250400,How to Survive,"This is exactly as advertised. A fun little, run around and kill zeds game, with some fun additions for crafting items and weapons. It combines humor with some seriously difficult challenges. I am only early into the game but so far the only bits I am disappointed with right now are the limited and infrequent places the game saves and the, apparent, inability to build your own shelters. I say apparent because I'm still early into the title. On the whole, so far, the game has had few 'zomg this is impossible moments' but plenty of 'I need to be careful how I do this' moments. In my opinion this is a refreshing change from games that are either impossibly hard to enjoy casually or disgustingly easy, even for people in a coma.   I'm kinda cheap but I think the $15 price is about perfect for the game you're getting. If you catch it on sale for 75% off like I did, you're scoring a major win.",1,0

257850,Hyper Light Drifter,"This game, simply put, is stunning.  The visuals are gorgeous, a detailed, sprite-based environment that's lush without ever feeling 'retro' or lifted from any particular 16-bit lineage. The design aesthetic veers into a Miyazaki-directs-Akira immersion, again without ever feeling derivative or uninspired, and with a game housing so very, very many unique assets, that's a triumph unto itself. New enemies, figures, statues, textures and cinematic vistas await with every passing screen. The game demonstrates the love and care that went into it at every turn.  The play is most definitely in the Souls-like vein, but with a gentle enough difficulty curve to reward extended play and the realization that much of the combat is a puzzle and not a brute force murder-expedition. Customization and upgrades teach you about the abilities you already have in an organic and fluid way. As it happens, there were so many things I could do, it took me a while to solve this puzzle, and it *is* a puzzle. The game supplies you with game information entirely pictorially, and the world leaves it to you to decipher its meanings and relevance. Even now, having beaten the game, I'm not 100% sure of everything that happened, and I don't need to be in order to appreciate its value as a game and as an intricate and elaborate art-piece. The mechanics themselves synergize with and reinforce the game's juice and aesthetic thoroughly and immersively.  Having a somewhat limited background in Souls-esque games, my girlfriend and I grabbed the title both to enjoy its vibe and to play through something intricate, technical and challenging. She's beaten the Souls games, and my limited experience playing them myself tells me that this game, these kinds of games, can and will frustrate you if you don't think outside your own box and your previous experience in games. The results are, however, thoroughly rewarding, and this game's difficulty unspools at a relaxed but ever-constant pace. By the game's end, enemies which at first were cripplingly difficult seemed a trifle, but were arranged in new and exciting ways that ceaselessly challenged me without ever forcing me into frustation or a detente with the game's learning curve.  Overall, I very highly recommend the game, and am so glad to see such a labor of love come to such a beautiful, perfect fruition. If you enjoy high fantasy blended with gritty cybepunk, Souls-meets-Zelda exploration and spelunking, and if the screenshots make you want to know more, you should just grab it and not think twice. It's a pay-full-price, come back for more experience, and we're already enjoying our second playthrough and looking forward to unearthing all the many, many more secrets I know this game has in store for us!",1,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Very bugged.   1. First thing I noticed that the game window start off very small, and it felt like it doesnt know what resolution my screen is at.   2. Secound thing I noticed when customizing character that there wasn't very many options. Most options you had to use real money to get. Like a different style helmet.   3. Even trying to confirm and leave the cutimization window was a pain.. I had to hit the 'X' button to leave and then I came back to see if it saved my options, as there was nothing indicating save, or save and go back.. very lazy.  4. I was doing the tutorial I noticed 3 options. Video, Guide, or training world.. no text on the side revealing what everything was; so I used common sence and noted to go into training world.   5. When I was in training I froze in place after completing a training tutorial.  Overall I like the graphics and the blood. The theme was ok.   It just left me depress. I expected more.. and now I am - $25 USD because I bought all the DLC's thinking already in my mind that this game was going to be it.  - Sorry. This is my honest review. As a new player.     ",-1,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,"I'm still in the very first real area of the game (area covered by the first radio tower). The game has crashed 3 times. There are lengthy cut scenes at the beginning of the game that cannot be skipped through as well, making recovery from the game crashing extremely tedious. The interface to select weapons, loot creatures on the ground, and view objectives is poor. The very first fight of the game (running away into the jungle and struggling with the pirate with a knife) requires mashing the jump button. 'Mashing' is a ridiculous action to perform on a PC, and undesirable to do on any platform outside of a video arcade. This game has potential (open world, interesting crafting system, and good voice acting), but the execution of the gameplay and stability is very subpar.  All of the above makes the game below average, and then there is the Uplay DRM. There are plenty of other reviews that cover Uplay, none of which are positive.  Edit: I am saddened that I cannot rate this game lower than 'Not Recommended'. On my second day of playing, while trying to load my saved game, the game has crashed 3 times on 3 attempts. No longer is the game just difficult to enjoy, it is now quite literally unplayable.",-1,1

Because the PC version is for DOS, you can only use a 4 button controller. I imagine there is a way to use a controller with more buttons but it seems like a lot of hassle. The PC version does have better graphics than the Playstation version.  I recommend getting the Playstation version instead if you can.",1,0

250600,The Plan,This game makes you question things. Why did I only want to go up? To escape the awful truth of reality and transcend even the bonds of gravity.

Why did I always push against the breezes when it didn't matter whether they pushed me around? It does matter and I'll fight anything that gets in the way of my dream to reach the stars.  I reached the stars why do I continue upwards? There is no end to what I can accomplish I will always try to strive higher.  Why did I die a horrible death for only doing the best I could?

10180,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"For me this is the 2nd best Call of Duty game only to Call of Duty 4 Modern Warfare. Sadly I do not recommend you purchase this in 2014. Graphically on my Windows 8.1 machine with GTX760 and 16GB memory the game has serious issues with jumping frames and gives the impression you're experiencing severe lag. (Can't find a fix anywhere!)  Moreover, as you'd probably guess with any Call of Duty game, it's been destroyed by kids who think they're hackers. Having some wannabe hacker remove your rank is not un-common. Fair matches are not impossible to find however you never know who is using a mod or what advantage they have given themselves.   Also be warned there are no leaderboards and only a few of the game modes have any activity. Search and Destroy is completely dead.   It's a shame each Call of Duty game is abandoned by the developers so soon after final release, especially considering how much the gaming community has given them.

18700,And Yet It Moves,"For some reason it wont let me put my full review in here, so I'll just put my conclusion  Conclusion: The game is fun and definitely worth playing if you can find it cheap. I got it as part of a 5 pack for 5$ and at that price it is a steal. I played through it relatively quickly and despite its occasional annoyances I enjoyed playing it and got a feeling of accomplishment out of beating difficult levels. I will state again though that it is very short, and I think didn't take the time to realize it's true potential, though I'd rather have a short poppy game then have a long drawn out bore fest.  (Fun represents how much I actually enjoyed playing the game) Fun: 8 (This represents novel mechanics that made me go “oh, that's kind of cool!”) Interesting: 9 (This represents the graphics / sound / style of the game) Style: 8 (This represents how long it took me to beat and replay value if any) Length: 5  Overall Rating: 8.5 / 10",1,0

While RPG maker is generally an engine for JRPGs it has been know to be used for other types of games, with many of them becoming well know, remember it's not only about the tool, it's all about your creativity and how to use it.

SPOILER ALERT FOR A MINOR PART BELLOW!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!      I came into this game not really expecting much as I am not a very emotional person. Oh, how I was wrong. I am writing this review 62 minutes into the game aproximately and I am doing it know so I can get some stuff off my chest. Holy ♥♥♥♥ this game doesn't just hit you in the feels, it takes saftey scissors and cuts your balls off with the feels. If you buy this game make sure you have some tissues stand by and I am not talking about mastubation you sick freek. Ok, back on topic. So about 30 minutes in you can adventure to an elderly couples house with a man and woman. The house has some very nice materials so you just wanna take the items, but what about them?? Its their property! Well I ♥♥♥♥ed up and took the items. When you reach back home you are greeted with a message by the character you explored with that you are sad about the descision I made. Go forward 30 minutes and I decide to go back to give items and maybe take some more because im a terrible human being. Well, they died. ♥♥♥♥ me. I could have saved them but no. Thats where the game hits you in the feels. As I said, im not one to cry with a movie, or tv show, or any such thing. But ♥♥♥♥, im not gonna lie I cried a little bit. It ♥♥♥♥ed me up but not in the way I dont wanna play anymore. Like in the way I want to donate and volunteer everything I have. This game is special, and never have I experienced such an attachment to some pixels in a game. ♥♥♥♥ is trippy. Thanks for listening and please just get this game.

377160,Fallout 4,"This game is good, but if you release a RPG game sequel, it should be an actuall RPG game. Thats the problem here  With the most horrible dialouge system EVER, because in fallout 3 and New vegas, some characters had tons of diolouge, and were really interesting, and you could ask so many questions to them. But now, it is all limited to 4 options!   I say options, but i really mean is an illusion of options. want to say no to a quest? TOO BAD you cant.  Now, calling this an RPG is like calling destiny an RPG,  they limited the ammount of perks to 72, as in, with this system i dont know how they could add more perks most of the perks just increase numbers, damage stats, and are really boring  If they hadnt removed half of their system, the perks would have more room to be interesting instead of increasing numbers. Perks are supposed to change your gameplay in some way, not add 25% damage, thats BORING  This game isnt all disapointment, here is what they got right quests, though few, were great exploration is fun customization of guns/ settlements  final rating- Disapointing final words- never played fallout? youll love it!, played fallout, youll probably be disapointed",-1,1

6020,STAR WARS™ Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy™,"This game is a gem. By today's standards a very old-fashioned gem, but underneath the crust of dated graphics is a diamond core. The single-player campaign is enjoyable to play through even today and gives a solid introduction to multiplayer, which is where the game really shines. The multiplayer community is not what it was but there are still servers which see activity. There are also a whole bunch of mods available; everything from skins to partial to total conversions.   If you've ever really wanted a lightsaber and to be able to wield it like a Jedi, I recommend you grab this little piece of history.

The AI was'nt the best, the interface clunky to say the least. I suppose it due lack of money and sales. The developer this week has annouced they are stopping developing more titles, and mainly supporting there other title Space Hulk Accession. You may get some enjoment if the title is dirt cheap, ie if like squad based TBS.

Gripes: The AI is useless for anyone except a total beginner, but with a game this complex what else can be expected? It's actually still a nice feature to have, even if can't win. There are still a few obscure bugs as of this review (exchanged Missile Envy playable in headline, Rule 6.1.1 not being applied to Iron Lady, Late War variant win condition...). Developers appear to be actively squashing bugs though, so hopefully these won't last long. The game lacks an easy way of referencing which cards are potentially in your opponent's hand. For asynchronous long-term play this means you currently have to keep notes outside the game itself, which is cumbersome. I've been assured this situation will be improved in a future patch.",1,0

4520,Full Spectrum Warrior,"Full Spectrum Warrior is a great game, though it is old, and it clearly shows. I remember playing this game on the origianl Xbox, and I enjoyed it so much that I remember that I ended up writing a report on it, as well as doing some research on it as well. Originally an Army idea to train soldiers, the game gave also saw the rise of another training aid that replaced the game, and created a bit of a controversy.   The game uses the typical Army scenario of a conflict in a made up country, using information from real world areas to make up things like demographics. You end up taking command of a squad, composed of two fireteams that mirror eachother in layout but have some different characters that attempt to give you a connection to the men; sort of giving them life. Going through various missions, you will occasionally pick up a Charlie team to help complete objectives, and utilize the sitrep system to save your progress.   The game can be tough, as it requires you to be a mix of cautious but aggressive. You need to use both teams to effectively move around the mission area, and to obviously complete your objective; this idea will get hammered into your brain fairly often and early on. Teammembers can get wounded, though I do believe the limit is one per team, and anymore then that will cause the mission to fail. If a teammember is wounded you only have so long to get to them before they bleed out, at that point one of your other soldiers must firemen carry, and you need to drop him back off at a CASEVAC/Resupply point; this eliminates another soldier from being combat effective. Though once you pick him up you can take your sweet time.   The game is not an FPS, not a TPS, if you haven't guessed already. Instead it is a real time squad tactics game, with some somewhat lackluster camera angles. However its a good buy that will keep you busy for several hours to say the least, and it has sequal out that adds some cool new features as well; like buddyteams. A fun game, and perhaps it connects more to me since I played it when it came out, and it harks back to those military days. Embrace the suck without actually embracing the suck.",1,0

330820,2064: Read Only Memories,"Read Only Memories is a game that I can easily recommend, yet not in the 'you should totally play it' way and more in the 'yeah, it's good' way. It starts great, but ends on a rather 'eh' note, which disappoints, yet still doesn't feel like playing the game was a waste or anything.  The game itself is quite obviously trying to redo the feel a lot of Japanese adventure games in 80-90s had, most notably Hideo Kojima's Snatcher. It drops the annoying part of those games (where you're forced to click all options several times, often without clear indication as to why, to get new interaction options), focuses on narrative, but does contain some puzzles and 'action' sequences. Instead of having a properly established main character, however, it goes for 'player as a main character' route, where you do have few things about your backstroy established, but you do everything else. Which... actually detracts from the enjoyment of the story a bit. Without a proper main character with a clear personality, like, say, Gillian Seed from Snatcher, a lot of dialogue directed at you is done in a more 'dry' informative and not REALLY interesting way, while the game tries to add it more character by using your robotic partner Turing a lot of lines during the dialogue. To the point where he becomes much more of a main character than your character ever does and all attempts at 'buddy cop' interactions, like Snatcher did with Gillian and Metal, just don't really work in this game. Probably, partially because of that, game just doesn't feel as interesting and engaging by the end, where events should feel big and important, yet feel like just another thing happening with some predictable twists and a rather boring ending.  It's also worth noting game's desperate attempts to adress the issues of equality in genders, sexual preferences, races and such. I'm saying 'desperate' simply because the way game handles a lot of those questions and its own characters often feels forced and not genuine. To the point where, I think, pretty much all major characters you interact with are bi- or homosexual and often look androgynous. Which could've worked with more characters, actual diversity, better dialogue and fleshed out lore (even through environmental storytelling) but doesn't. It doesn't detract from the game much, but just feels more like a 'political correctness school play' than a story at times.  Another weird thing about the game is that while it's billing itself as a cyberpunk game, the future society it shows isn't actually cyberpunk in it's 'proper' sense. There mostly no feeling of actual dystopia of expensive corporations vs low level of life for a lot of citizens and such - most locations you visit are pretty nice, most characters you see easily got gene and cybernetic enhancements and the poorest character in the entire game seems to be the player character, who still can by anything in the game without ever caring about money. And while there are social conflicts and 'purity' vs 'enhancements' clashes, we're mostly told of them and what we see is very tame and doesn't feel dangerous or important.  So, in the end, the game just doesn't deliver on all the promise it builds up at the start... yet is still enjoyable enough to play through and like some characters and moments. So - yep, it's good, just not as good as it could've been.",1,0

315080,Foresight,"Foresight: A Space RTS, with Base build, Armadas and Commanders.   Well you can compare this game to such classics like The Outforce or Conquest: Frontier Wars and Starwars Empire at War.  You do build in Space a Base , collect Resources like in C&amp;C and can jump to other systems like in Conquest: Frontier Wars. So the map is separated in sectors like just 4 to. 20 or more. in each sector you can build a base to collect resources and they all are connected with wormholes.   You have 3 Factions here, 2 really on energy like in C&amp;C, so no energy no turrets power and slowly production, the other is unique, they need blood banks. Not enough blood and you units start to lose Hit Points.  Units are like in Starwars Empire at War. So you can build from small scouts to huge Capital Battleships.   The Unique idea is here you must place fighter and bombers in bigger ships to move them around, like the Protoss Carrier, but you build them in Shipyard, not on the capital ship.  Lots of Corvettes, Gunship and other support ships are here too.  Well best part is the unit limit, to increase this you must get a 'Fleet Captain' on a ship, that you can assign ships to him. So you have like limit for 10 units, Assign them to the captain and now you can buy another 8 units and so on.   So if you loose a Fleet Captain you have like 18 Units and cant buy more units. Because you are with 8 units too high by the limit. Pretty interesting mechanic in my Opinion.  In most RTS its just some kind of house that is placed somewhere randomly. Here its you fleet commander. Story is challenging and interesting, the AI is like in Tiberium Wars, the game itself feels like an Space C&amp;C.   You can by the way choose here the Tech Level like in Red Alert 1 or set the Amount of Start Resources. Like in Starwas Empire at War you can increase the game play speed, yes you have game speed controls here.   For this game I can put my Hand in fire, an extreme good AAA Indie RTS game.",1,0

218620,PAYDAY 2,"I am going to be straight with you here, this is a game which: Cost money to buy as of writing this,  has almost a hundred bucks worth of DLC.  It is a game that since recently has microtransactions despite the developers bluntly stating it would never be added, microtransactions that compared to it's own DLC is crazy overpriced, 4.99 for a weapon pack compared to 2.49 to a single random weapon skin, HUD elements that give certain focus to the microtransactions and their related elements.  On top of this the microtransactions were added in a 'weapon rebalance' update which clearly lacked proper playtesting, with things like the minigun being able to give you a speed boost since they didn't pay enough attention to the 'game' part of the update to consider removing the the speed boost on the light minigun mod when they removed the speed penalty that it compensated for.   This game currently is priced at 19,99€ without discounts, with DLC priced at 109,92€ and keys/drills, giving a single random skin to a weapon which might be for a weapon DLC you don't have, at 2.20€.  With more than 600 hours on this game and a good 10 with the new 'weapon rebalance' I am secure in my statement, that is way too much to ask for when you cannot deliver promised content, a balanced game and functional net-code. ;c I don't think I'll be keeping those helmets flying for much longer.   A certain update have implemented a way to fairly easily aquire stat-equivalents of skins with stat boosts, making skins more properly aesthetic only, to me this is enough to keep playing but unless you are already invested I'm having a hard time recommending it.  Recent cross-promotions characters have also been suitably priced at zero.",-1,0

254700,Resident Evil 4,"An HD remake of one of the greatest games I've ever played. The graphics look pretty good and the lighting is much improved over the vanilla 2007 version. The HD textures of the unmodded game however cannot match the image quality of the modded HD textures of the 2007 version. So the most signifcant improvement is the 60fps (if your PC can handle it though)  M&amp;K controls are awesome once you get used to them, and if you don't mind to adjust them manually till you find your best settings. The Mouse control is very responsive and the aiming is very smooth. Those who suffer from Mouse responsiveness issues I suggest them to adjust the sensitivety as the default setting is very slow.   One of the downsides of this version is that it requires a hefty CPU to run at 60fps -(you need at least a CPU that is based on Nehalem architecture from Intel (First gen Core i5s/ i7s) or a K10 CPU from AMD (Phenom IIs) to have 60 fps)-. However it is not hard on any high-end or mid-range graphics card that has released 5 years ago or later. I played the game on 3 cards and all of them managed to get constant 60fps at 1920x1080 8x MSAA and all settings on High : GTX 470, HD 7950 and GTX 780 Ti.  I highly recommend this game, I give it a 9/10.",1,0

24740,,"At the time of writing I've played Burnout Paradise for a couple of hours. Overall I would recommend it but it has its problems and it is by no means the best Burnout game I've played. The arcade-style driving is really good fun, so much so that on the strength of it alone I will recommend the game. The cars are easy to handle even at the preposterous speeds you will normally be travelling and the game is fairly forgiving when you hit into walls and barriers. There are a large variety of cars of various types and you unlock them at a pleasing steady pace. There are no real world cars but that doesn't bother me becuase cars are boring.  To try out events you simply stop at an intersection and press a button. On the whole the event types are good. There are a few subtly different types of races and a mode in which you have to destroy as many cars in a time limit There's also a mode that's new to me called 'marked man' where you have to get across the city in one piece while a load of other cars try to destroy you. It's good fun if (so far) a bit easy. One let down is the crash events. In older Burnout games these would be carefully choregraphed sets which required ingenuity to score high damage. Now you simply crash into whatever happens to be in the section at the time. Success in this mode now feels more luck than design.  Throughout the city there are tonnes of jumps and shortcuts. Just driving around with no purpose but to find these is very fun and this is when the open-world setting is really played to its strengths. On the other hand, the open world setting also has the effect of turning races more into exercises of navigation than driving skill or tactics. So far whether or not I have won a race has depended almost entirely on which route I take and not really how I take it. Every race has proceeded thus: the race starts and within 20 seconds at most I have a healthy lead, then I'm not sure where to go because the mini-map is so zoomed in so I take a road which heads in the general direction of the finish line, that road turns out to be a windy road with no exits which takes me back in the opposite direction, then it either it takes me too far out of the way and I quit the race (and annoyingly there is no way to restart the race) or its a minor enough inconvience that I can make up the difference over the other races who all drive incredibly slowly. Now in time I can see that I will get used to the layout of the city and this problem will dissipate as the city is reasonably small. But I imagine this will lead to boredom at the familiarity of the tracks and the setting.   The game is well presented though the menus can be a bit confusing to navigate and I hate being bugged all the time to register online. The soundtrack is reasonably small and consists mostly of bland rock music (but with notable exceptions). Additionally, the DJ who talks to you frequently has already started to grate on me. I imagine he will become insufferable if I put many more hours into the game.   Overall still a good arcade racer but I can't help feel it would have been better to ignore the trend of the time for open world locations and just give us another solid entry in this enormously enjoyable franchise.",1,0

Production quality simply isn't in the same level as the other bigger RPGs i've grown and i'm used to play.",-1,1
313160,Farming Simulator 15,"Unfortunately, I just can't quite recommend this game. If there were a star rating, I'd give it a pretty neutral rating, but since there's no inbetween option, it gets a no. Here's why:  Cons for the game  - Very little help/ instructions. Almost none at all. This is the single biggest reason for the low rating. After all of the effort put into making this game, you couldn't add an extra couple lines of text? One example, balers. There are 2 types of bales in the game, each made from it's own baler. There is no description as to which kind of bale each machine makes, you just have to know. There are also machines and trailers that interact with these 2 different types of bales. Do these other machines specify which type of bale they work on? Nope! Of course not! Because adding a single line of text, even just a 2 word 'xxxx Bale' discription would be too much work. Another example is a harvester, the Mex 5. I bought it when I had a little extra money and tried to figure out what it's for since, again, there was no description saying how to use it. I tried cutting different things and no results. Finally I had to look it up online to get an answer.  -Very 'hands on', you can hire workers for some tasks but not many. Alot of the jobs, including what I would consider to be some of the most boring, you cannot hire a worker for. Why? Again, given the scope of the game, would it really be that much harder to implement a feature that you already made on some other duties? Example, you can hire workers for some harvesters but not others. Beet farming looks like it would be the most profitable use of a field, but it takes 10x the work since you cannot hire workers to harvest them until you buy one of the single most expensive machines in the game. Instead you have to sit in the tractor yourself, with one of the narrowest harvester heads in the game. It took half an hour to harvest one of the smallest fields, compared to the under 10 minutes of letting a paid worker do it for me, and I only make about 2x the money. Of course even then beets take up much more room, 3x, so that means 3x the trips from the field to the market where you are selling them.  I suppose those are the only cons that come to mind for me. However, they are nearly game breaking in my opinion. You can *almost* play this as a management game, which I would prefer, but too much of the game requires you to actively control the machinery. Also spending hours, and game money, trying to figure out what the machinery does because they could not be bothered to add a description, is just rediculous.  Pros:  ... well I wouldn't say there are any, just some middleground 'okay' things. Decent or better graphics, though graphics are pretty low on my scale of what makes a game 'good'. Some jobs can be given to workers, allowing you to do other things, or even nothing if you want, while they work. Yep, that's about it in the plus columb for me.",-1,1

232970,Thunder Wolves,"Thunder Wolves is an arcade style game with helicopters.The game does't bring any thing new to the genre , it is casual game and you will get what you think you will get. First of all, the graphics are decent enough , the helicopter model is detailed and really good textured but the rest ,like the npc,vehicle, buildings,etc are kinda bad but decent enough as you don't really have time to check them while flying you heli.The terrains ranges from normal green plains to sand deserts and the locations aswell. Second, the gamepaly is the most important thing in any game and in this game it's a bit repetitive as you pretty much do the same thing, fly from point A to point B and shot a bunch of units or destry a few Oil tanks but unlocking new helicopters and new skins keeps you entertained enough to play the game till you finish it. The story is a typical 90's story in which the bad guys is ... and you have to ... but you don't know until the very end. ( I won't spoil you ,hehe) And let's not forget about the music , you will have in the background around 2-4 songs, old 80-90 rock, if you like rock,like me, you will enjoy it even though it might become a bit too repetitive at some points but the music feets the gameplay . In the end, the game worths a try but don't buy it at full price, as for 15 euros (my regional price ) you can get a better game , wait for a discount or for a Bundle but if you see it on sales don't hesitate, is really good game and it will keep you busy for about 3 hours and more if you want to get all the achievements which are easy to get and fun trying to get them. 7.9/10",1,0

268870,Satellite Reign,"Coerce. Employ. Steal. Deploy. Track. Stalk. Assault. Destroy.  A bit of history.  Computer games were something of a wonder back when I was in school. They enabled me to live adventures that I was otherwise unable to realize in real life. Each new game had something fresh in it, but one that stood out for me was called SYNDICATE. Released in 1993 by Bullfrog, it stuck me with its SVGA (640x480) isometric graphics, vast open maps and freedom to achieve your objectives as you saw fit. Armed with a huge arsenal of useful weapons, the sheer carnage you could unleash on the screen with your four cybernetically augmented agents, made it one of the most memorable games of the 90’s. In 1996, a sequel called SYNDICATE WARS was released, using a modified engine from Bullfrog’s, Magic Carpet, it added fully 3D level maps and changed some of the mechanics. It also ramped up the difficulty of the missions with the final ones being nigh impossible to beat. The sequel struggled beneath the shadow the original it would be another sixteen years before a fresh attempt was made. In 2012, Starbreeze Studios tried to remodel the game as an FPS and, while I appreciated the effort, most didn’t. Paradox Entertainment considered a spiritual successor, The Cartel, which has still yet to pan out. The foundation gathered dust. And then, a kickstarter project called Satellite Reign was launched.  So what is Satellite Reign?  It is the year 2188 and Steven Dangler the head of Dracogenics had developed a way of transcending death. His technology of copying human memory and consciousness to cloned bodies has made him rich and powerful. But power never lasts. You were chosen to lead a group of four cybernetic agents to topple Dangler’s rule. Mechanically, it’s a remake of Syndicate Wars rather than the original Syndicate game (the lead designer of Satellite Reign and Syndicate Wars is the same person – Mike Diskett) with the addition of stealth elements reminiscent of Commandos Behind Enemy Lines.  The Agents.  The first major difference, compared to the originals is that your agents are not identical. Each one is a different class of a field operative, with distinct skills which can be further upgraded, adding an RPG-like twist.  The Soldier is a walking tank. He can carry the most weapons and equipment, has the most hit points and offers purely combat oriented skillsets. Second is the Support, who works as a medic boasting useful support abilities such as the World Scan (for highlighting connections between cameras, gates, power sources, hackable terminals etc.) or the Team Stims which slows down time. The Hacker is responsible for controlling CCTV cameras, doors, gates and taking control of NPCs like civilians or soldiers. Or even call in armed drones to aid the team in firefights. The Assassin uses a monofilament sword to kill even the most powerful enemies with one swift blow without alerting other enemy combatants, bypass security checkpoints in thermoptic camo or zoom above their heads using zip lines scattered around the city.  The Setting.  The game is set in a big seamless city that takes cues from Blade Runner, featuring even the constant rain. Divided into four main districts, each with its own unique architecture and feel, it makes for an interesting cyberpunk setting. You are absolutely free to roam a given district, and later the whole city, as you see fit. Of course, there are places your agents will not be tolerated, often pointed out by your handler to undertake missions inr. These hot-spots are navigated entirely as you please: guns blazing chaos, full stealth infiltration, or murdering silently from the shadows. There is no set missions order, leaving you free to play as you choose, but the missions are not that varied and some of them (especially the ones that give you distinct wide bonuses such as slowing down CCTV cameras’ detection time) are identical in nature in every district. What salvages the situation though is the layout of each areas remains unique.  Guns and R&amp;D.  The arsenal at your disposal is varied. Throughout the game you will have access to dozens of different weapons from pistols to plasma cannons. Combined with auxiliary gear like force fields, medikits, grenades and body augmentations means a strong degree of customisation is available. New weapons, gear and augmentations are acquired through various missions. Some of them will be available as blueprints ready for immediate manufacture, some are prototypes which have to be researched first in order to produce more. Funds and scientists used to do this are almost literally lying on the streets of the city. To get funds flowing you hack ATMs scattered here and there and to get you lab stuff you use the World Scan ability to locate them among regular citizens (just drag the mouse over each of them to get to know who is who). This system works well and the only thing I found lacking about it is the fact that there is no graphical representation of the augmentation process.  Combat and Stealth.  Cover plays an important role in Satellite Reign. In combat, it provides cover from incoming enemy fire,while, in stealth,d it hides your agents from enemy sight. It’s not foolproof - smaller pieces of cover can be destroyed by concentrated small arms fire or with explosives. Enemies themselves come in different shapes and sizes. Lowly grunts sport rifles and a bulletproof vests while power-armoured enforcers wield miniguns. Giant four-legged walkers stalk battlefields, showering overkill. They react to your play style, taking cover or calling in reinforcements.   Most of their actions are colour-coded with their flashlights – white is normal status, yellow for alert and red for hostile. Fire fights are enjoyable and frantic at times, sometimes putting you up against 10+ enemies at once. If your agents happen to fall in combat they can be revived by other agents but each revive decreases the window of rescue. If a fatality occurs your agents can be brought back to life at special beacons you activate in the city, which also act as fast travel waypoints. You have to remember though that each time your agent dies, they lose stat bonuses. Death is still bad.  The Graphics.  Satellite Reign is a mix of colourful neons, commercials, holograms, clean stylised areas, industrial spaces and dirty little streets realised brilliantly on the Unreal engine. It all looks and feels right Efforts have been made to ensure different corporations and organizations as well as enemy type each have their own look and style of armour to set them apart. There’s some criticism regarding your agent’s uniforms looking too bright but it does help them stand out of a crowded screen. The lack of free camera rotation is a bigger obstacle.   Conclusion.  Satellite Reign is a worthy tribute to the Syndicate franchise and should be of interest to fans of tactical combat games. It leaves room for player improvisation, allowing several different tactics to find success in each objective. It’s a smart cyberpunk homage that’s worth checking out.",1,1

The space combat can be fun however it can get a little tedious and frustrating (for me in particular, being an angry gamer) at times.. All these problems all just combine for an average space combat sim in my opinion. Also the game itself honestly is not good enough to be compared to other games of its genre specifically in ways of visual appeal/graphics, after all isn't space meant to be a 'beautiful enigma'?.. e.g Star Conflict is free to play (although some things must be payed for) however the controls and visuals are far superior than SSZ and for me (Star Conflict) 'destroys' SSZ in the field of which SSZ professes to be the best at: Combat.. Strike Suit Zero has a good story and can be entertaining at points however those are the only positives I can state about this game.. If you are to get this game.. get it on sale..

Edit: Ok in all seriousness, This is a VERY touching game.   Before I start dwelling any further, if you have even considered buying this game, I'd recommend beating the game first before looking up info about it.   It is a very personal experience that I think anyone that enjoys an RPG or just a modern game that has a retro appearance should get.  As someone who is looking into being a game designer, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND playing this game and taking notes on how to make a good game.  Characters are loveable and memorable, even if some come off as rough when you first meet them.  Music always seesm to fit in with the situation, and can even envoke a serious emotionall response.  Gameplay offers some difficulty, but its not ever too hard( unless you go genocide, then good luck with those 2 bosses...)  It offers a good sense of humor, as well as some pretty dark or depressing moments too. Honestly feel bad for the monsters.  It all melds together to make a truely unforgettable experience. Sure, some of the community is kinda overreacting by inserting itself into other genres, but it's honestly too good for it to be ruined.  I'd honestly consider this one of THE best games of this decade, or even of this CENTURY.  If you get the money, PICK. THIS. UP. If you grew up with games like the original Final Fantasy, Earthbound, or any other RPG or comedic and heartfelt games, you will not regret it.  (Good job/Goddammit) Toby.

364360,Total War: WARHAMMER,"No idea of the mixed reviews i was really expecting atleast positive on average. This really is the best total war i ever played and this is from playing the original shogun when released and every other release since then. Honourable mention of playing Horned rat and Dark Omen religiously.  I have currently played 5 hours of empire campaign and obviously as i play i will change or add stuff to this review. I will make it short and sweet for the moment.  Firstly diplomacy i feel is alot more responsive then in other total war games. The AI when getting crushed will offer favourable peace terms. It will offer to help go to war with other nations your at war with for gold. It seems to offer trade deals much more frequent then in other games. I feel its at a good place because in previous total war games the AI will barely ever agree to trade unless it totally benefits them, never join your wars, only accept white peace even if totally crushed.  Secondly early unit variety is really good. In previous total war games the campaign was a utter bore where everyone started with milita units and you had spend ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ amount of gold to slowly get up from milita to basic swordsman and even more insane amount of gold to get to the next stage of unit progression. In Warhammer? Well for the Empire i already start with swordsmen, halberdiers, spearmen, gunners, crossbowmen, imperial knights. Then a few turns later i got pistolers, greatswordsman and mortars. If i was playing Rome i just bloody have peasent milita and auxillaries for the first 20 turns. The not to mention the biggest change in this game; heroes. They act like Kensai in shogun where they are a 1 man army. It so awesome with all the different spells, skills and item customization and mount customization this is a giant step in the right direction for total war series.  Thirdly the games economy seems to be alot better compared to other total wars. Before, a 20 unit stack would hurt your economy in the beginning quite badly but in my current game i have 2 20 unit stacks and 3 8 unit stacks and i still have 1000 gold a turn income. This game offers the ability to make more armies so the grand scale of things seem alot bigger. Also buildings are quite cheap allowing you to field armies alot easier rather then having to hoard so much money for a simple upgrade.  And to end with i have to say the graphics and the physics are brilliant. People fly around when getting hit by trolls. Cavalry charges totally mince enemies with bodies flying in the opposing direction. Magic looks beautiful and so do the maps. Siege maps look beautiful all the buildings and walls look great.   No crashes yet. No FPS drops.I have a average PC and been playing on high. This is probably the best vanilla release they ever done.  9.5/10",1,0

Here's a small amount of information about the game.  -This game has plenty of story content. -You play in third-person. -There combat, however, you have only one type of foe to defeat (It is mainly Quick-time-events which you press two buttons at once.) -The game is considered short; depending on your playstyle, the length may vary. -If you've read the 'About This Game' section, you will know that you are a detective. There are more than one case which you can solve, and they are similar to a puzzle where you must find objects or clues leading to the truths of the cases. (This is the puzzle element.)

8500,EVE Online,"There will never be another game like it.  It is not your traditional MMO. It relies heavily on the fact that it's all about its player-created universe. It is a little slow paced, and you do will not want to do PVE for PVE's sake forever.  But where else can you actually watch empires rise and fall detached from some developer's scripted boring plot? We recently had a war where half the playerbase was hired to the rough equivalent of $11,000 to go destroy one of the biggest, longest-standing, and most toxic entities in the game.  Beyond that, there's smaller games of cat and mouse to be played inside low-security space and wormholes, and the thrills of actual risk that are so thoroughly divorced from MMOs and shooters. When you blow up someone else's ship, it stays gone, providing a satisfaction to destruction I can't get from WoW or Overwatch.  Give it a try. It'll take some work to figure out - I've played a long time and I'm not even close - but each piece the game reveals to me is another reward.",1,0

251130,Chroma Squad,"A creative tribute to the Tokusatsu genre that many have grown up to or still enjoy. Having team work and acrobatics effect audience levels was an interesting mechanic that allowed to the player to decide on how much of either to do to maximize the attendance to gain more fans/money per episode. The attendance machanic in general seemed a bit easy to abuse to an extent, should have a negative factor if either is overly used.  Having different characters to choose from at the beginning for each role is a really nice touch. It allowed to add in variety to characters with the abilities that affected the gameplay. This allows the player to choose how they would like to play their games, and not have a stagnant gameplay with fixed characters for the storyline only.  Storyline progressed at a decent pace and was well thought out in respect to what Tokusatsu's usually revolved around. But also adding in a bit of flare by blurring reality with fiction.  One thing that was unimpressive after a few levels would be the minion's designs. During a level that had a Boss Mob, could have had the minion's designs centered around that particular Boss in the later stages. It's understandable at the beginning since it is representing the beginning stages of a starter company.",1,0

98400,Hard Reset,"After adopting the pros and cons way of reviewing a game, I'm going to re-review this game (if there's such a word). Overview: Hard reset is a game the happends in the future. It has many options and you don't just go and kill the enemies like most of the FPS games, you need to find secrets and destroy things like explosives or digital machines to open new areas.  I enjoyed this game very much, it was very interesting, the maps were good, the story was awesome. Weapons here are nice because you can choose (plasma or rifle) your weapon path (you eventually get all of them). The enemies weren't to strong, but when they needed to be a bit hard, it was there. Many kinds of enemies, flying, running, giant, shooters, melee and more and more. Explosives - my best friend, may be yours as well! This game is replayable - you can just play it over and over in other difficulties without getting bored.  Pros and cons: Pros: +Pretty long +Has good graphics +Has a good storyline +Voice acted +Has 'secrets' +Has achievements +Has many kinds of weapons +Has many upgrades of weapons +Has a free DLC +Has awesome boss fights +Challenging puzzles while fighting enemies +Has more than one difficulty  Cons: -No cards -Storyline is hard to understand -Has 'detectors' of various things (enemies, N.A.N.O, etc.)  Bottom line: will get the 9 out of 10 :/ ",1,1

332880,DSY: Don't Shoot Yourself,"This game was fun to an extent. However there is very little variation in the levels which led to me getting bored nearer the end of the game.   The concept of the game is great and very unique. You play as a small shape that shoots bullets from behind as it moves along. It does this at a constant rate. To finish the level you have to simply do what it says in the title of the game and 'don't shoot yourself'. You have to successfully manouvere the areas presented to you and avoid 100 bullets. If you win you send out a blue bullet that destroys the outer area and releases you free.   This concept is very fun for first 20 levels or so but dies out after a while. The problem with the game comes from the fact that it doesn't do enough to engage you throughout the game by adding more obstacles to new levels. In later levels you do have obstacles such as changing walls, portals and things that shoot bullets back at you. Although this does add to the gameplay it doesn't feel like it makes much of an addition into the way the game is played. You still continue on as you was before just flying about aimlessly. It seems to make no difference to the way in which you control the character or play the game.   Another problem is that the game was quite obviously designed with touch controls on a mobile device in mind. It doesn't translate well to pc. As much so that you get glitches that make it impossible to use some elements of the game. At one point of the game it introduces to you portals that can teleport you from one side of the level to the other. This sounds great in concept but when translated to pc controls with the mouse it breaks. This is because your character is bounded to travel where your mouse pointer is located on the screen. So when you go through the portal the character gets confused and tries to go back to your mouse pointer location as quickly as possible leaving you zooming through the field of flying bullets with no control whatsoever over your character. This problem made me have to avoid using portals completely making the game significantly harder to play.  Each level has 3 sets of difficulty ratings. It has 'normal', 'hard' and 'impossible which give 1,3 and 5 stars respectively for completing it. The way the difficulty is raised is by the speed of which the bullets are emitted from your character and travel around the screen. This does add an extra challenge to gameplay for people, like me, that found the original difficulty of the game to be too easy. It is also needed to complete a certain amount of stars to unlock boss levels and move on to the next tier of levels. This addition is welcomed and makes for a much longer and more enjoyable experience.  I also want to comment on the graphics and sountrack of the game. The graphics style is very nice looking and presents itself well in a simplistic but very colourful manor. The whole game sticks to this graphics style and I believe it benefits well from it. The soundtrack is very well implemented as well and leaves for a very calming and relaxing experience and is very nice to listen to,   So in summary I did really enjoy the game for a while, but I feel it does need a lot of improvement to be worth a full price purchase. Currently I would say you should consider waiting for a sale or a bundle to buy this game but I would definitely recommend playing it at this stage.   TheIronicGamers rating system",1,1

I'll get a bachelor's degree, a master's degree, and then a doctorate. I'll dedicate my life 100% to the pursuit of this dream. My grades will be at the very top. And I'll specialize in oncology. I'll conduct researches, build the largest laboratory dedicated to the research of cancer and it's cure in the world. I'll collect so much data, gain such a deep understanding of cancer, and hammer so much information in my brian, that my mind will instantly formulate a cure just by looking at a single cancer cell in the microscope. This will be the biggest breakthrough of humanity! One of the biggest enemies of mankind has been defeated! The whole world shall celebrate! But not me. Not yet. My work is not yet done. The research goes on. Soon cancer will become a simple disease you can cure as easily as a flu, you'll get a simple pill in the local drug store and BAM! All is well again, the cancer cells die and get replaced by healthy ones. Cancer is something of the past. So what good is it to be a researcher of cancer now? Either way, the research must go on. It can't stop. It's not over yet.  After a few years, a new type of mutation, completely immune to the current medicine, is discovered. It kills millions around the world. It takes 10 years until a definitive cure for this new type of cancer is devised. That mutation, I named Super Meat Boy. Just so I could say I have finally rid the world of this cancer.  And so I look around me. I'm old, weak, and lying in my bed. It's not long for me now. I begin pondering on my life. I recall all the choices I had made. Was it really worth it, to dedicate the entirety of my life just to show my displease with a game I played when I was young? It was actually a pretty good game, so all of this was fueled by my own short temper. If I went back to that day, would I still choose this same path? I reach around to the side, open a drawer and from it I take an old picture frame, showing severe signs of aging and physical abuse. It depicts the development team of this game. 'Hell ♥♥♥♥ing yes, ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s!' I say as I give the frame the middle finger. I fling across the room, and as it shatters against the wall, I take my last breath.     ...  I... wake up? I see a group of men speaking what seems like English but with a heavy accent. Oh, that's right. I kind of expected humanity to eventually do this. To somehow revive the minds of people that did great deeds for mankind. It's a bit more sophisticated than I had expected. It seems they were able to upload my brain into an artificial biological body. Pretty much, it means I live again. One of the scientists explains to me that first I need to run a bunch of tests to ensure I get used to my new body, and that my mind works as expected. Two weeks of tests goes by. On the 17th day of testing, it's time to test my mind reaction, spatial perception and time perception. The scientist explains to me that I will have to play a game from their time. It's a simple 16-bit platformer said to be pretty hardcore. Oh. My. GOD",1,1

203770,Crusader Kings II,This is a good game that's game mechanics simulate feudalism well. What you spend most of your time doing in this game is managing your relationships with your vassals as you don't directly control much territory. The higher your relations are with your various vassals are the more tax they pay and troops they provide as levies. This game uses the same engine as Europa Universalis IV but is not as pretty. If you are going to choose one of these I would recommend getting EU4 over this one. If you do get this game make sure that you get it in a bundle with all the DLC's as there are multitudes of them and the mods that are worth playing require the DLC to play.,1,0

212680,FTL: Faster Than Light,"I felt as though I had to post a review to this game. It is one of the greatest games I have played in recent history and takes me right back to my youth.  Is it for everyone... no, but then what game is.  Some people have posted reviews that criticise the difficulty, permadeath and randomness of the game. In my opinion it is these elements that make this game the gem that it is. Too often in modern games I find myself redoing missions and short segments of missions when they don't go the way I want, it is a hard habit to break (though one I'm trying to), and ultimately takes all the enjoyment out of some games and leaves my victory feeling hollow and meaningless.  In FTL I can't do this (that I know of and don't want to find out if I can!) and therefore every decision counts. Is it unfair sometimes... YES, but then so is life and you've got to ride out the bad to really appreciate the good. One of my favourite games of all time was Alex the Kidd on the SEGA Master System, and I never completed it. I'm sure if I could have saved the game I would have, but don't think I would look back on the game with such fond memories.  Some people will not be able to handle investing large chunks of time in a game to have their journey irrevocably cut short by chance or stupidity. If that is you DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!! If however, you enjoy a challenge and find as much enjoyment in a good game whether you win or lose then give this one a chance. You will lose (often!!!), but when you win you know it will be worth it.  And as a parting comment, my favourite moment so far: when during a very successful run, with my ship nearly fully upgraded, fighting a particularly tough pirate ship, having repelled their boarding party through opening the airlocks and watching them suffocate against my bulkheads, we both simultaneously landed the killing blow with our beam weapons. Mutually assured destruction has never been so satisfying. And so one story ends, and another begins...",1,0

That's fair enough i would say, it is a cool idea for a vault, and i was not surprised that vault tech was able to do something like that. The problem is with Shaun. As soon as i saw Kellog kidnapping him i was sure he was going to be the head of the institute. C'mon guys you are way better than that. When the player finally manages to step into the institute you CAN'T make shaun the boss of it. IT IS SUCH AN OBVIUOS CHOICE. I did not surprised me at all, it destroyed all my espectations and it made me feel like 'Uh all this noise to get there just to find out that this kid is the head of the evil ones and he acts like a jerk', so boring.  Then the factions. First of all the minute men, they should have deserved way more importance and quests than the other factions, because they are the good ones! C'mon people what are you thinking about? The railroads were so stupid and pointless and you made them look so cool and great while they were so useless. But no you had to make Preston such an empty and stupid character that just tells you that there is another settlement that needs help.. Who should really destroy the institute? The selfish BOS which will keep their technology? Or the stupid rail road that wants to save just the synths? I know, the player can destroy the institute with the minutemen but at the end, they are still a bunch of losers that can barely stay together. Which is ok at the beginning but they could have grown way more and become a great faction. Also, why there is no way to keep all the faction alive and create a sort of deal between them? I thought talking was one of the main weapons that your character could use..  The karma component just went away.. the only people you should care about are the companions that will judge you. Guys i remeber three dog saying that i was a piece of garbage cause i did so many wrong things and people would fear or love me around the world. Every little choice would make a change in the game experience, every single choice. In fallout 4 you can't say no to stuff, there are just rude or polite ways of saying yes. This is stupid guys, so stupid.  The settlements idea looked cool in the beginning, but then it became a pain in the ♥♥♥. So many stupid settlements, do you think i am playing the sims and i want to spend my time building ♥♥♥♥ that doesen't even snap togheter properly? Really? It would have been nice if you made like 5 big settlements, with their own story and missions and things to DISCOVER, because that's what fallout is, not stupid small useless settlements without personality in a large number, that you can armor them with the biggest guns and they will always cry and get their ♥♥♥ kicked.  So far the DLCs are horrible. I was not going to buy the season pass but i tried and Automatron is such a joke. Do you wanna compare it with the other dlc that YOU produced? I was so excited to face the mechanicist and it took me 30 mins to finish the dlc. What i had at the end? I weak story, with a weak enemy. And who needs robots? Why you made it the main thing? It's useless, it is just like the settlements, people will lose 5 minutes building robots and thats it.. You could have used this feature way better and not only, go there kill robots take the radar find the mechanicist stop her done. I remeber going to the Pit, to point lookout, and know the charcaters and the area, this girl was such an empty character she did not give me anything. You made us control a ♥♥♥♥ing army of robots in New Vegas and now you give us this empty robot dlc? Cmon! Some of the new weapons were cool tho.  I will keep playing this just for the mods, so be thankful to your community.  I think you owe us an apology guys, i am really disappontied  PS : I want to know what's the point of giving to the player a power armor and let him kill a deatclaw like it was a molerat in the very first mission? Like that they lost all their scary factor...  PPS : Fallout shelter was such a boring game.  Be ashemed guys..  Goodbye",-1,1

261640,Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel,"It's fun, but not quite as fun as Borderlands 2.   The story is a bit weak, the NPCs are a little flat, and the humor feels meh. I'm just guessing here, but a lot of it is because 2k Australia created it. They went heavy handed trying to infuse the game with Aussie-ness. Pickle, one of the NPCs, feels like such a terrible caricature. Cor! Blimey! He's one step away from Crocodile Dundee. (Edit: Scratch that. Apparently it's a Cockney accent. Still a bit much either way.) And sadly, because we're in space, incendiary just doesn't feel useful anymore. Some of the mechanics are terrible too. Trying to jump some of the gaps require more precision than necessary. And Deadlift, the second boss, is a lot tougher than he should be.   So why am I recommending the game? Because all the playable characters are well built. I've played everyone, including the expansion characters, save for Claptrap and loved each of their skill trees. In BL2, I didn't care much for Salavdor, Zer0, Gaige or Krieg. But the PS skills are nailing it. Also, cryo as an element is an awesome replacement for slag, which really only worked in teamplay anyway. And while jumping/boosting feels a little gimmicky, it's still fun to float around and bring down a butt-slam.  In short, as part of the series, it's a bit of a letdown. But if you can overlook that and pretend it's a one-off, it's still fun. Here's looking forward to Borderlands 3.",1,1

237930,Transistor,"Well, that was playthrough #1. After doing all challenges, listening to and reading everything I possibly could and only once having to use the 'Retry' function, Steam tells me I have 7 hours under my belt.  The following is my critique of the game, ignoring the New Game+ mode (for now). While I do reference Supergiant Games' first title, Bastion, quite heavily, the points I make should also be accessible to players who have yet to play Bastion (seriously, get that game). While I try to be objective, some sections of this review are highly subjective; the game suffers from virtually no technical (and thus 'objectively objective') faults and what I point out as bad may appear as 'creative' or 'challenging' or just 'different' to others. Please refer to additional reviews and critiques before you decide whether or not you want to buy Transistor.   THIS CRITIQUE CONTAINS VERY MINOR SPOILERS!  If you want to avoid even those, skip to the conclusion section at the end.  Transistor is an isometric tactical Action-RPG with a linear story.  First of all, the things I was happy with -   THE GOOD  : -  The MUSIC , obviously. Darren Korb and Ashley Barret did an amazing job and the music leaves little to be desired. It's a different style than Bastion's soundtrack, so, of course, whether you like it more or less than Bastion's is a matter of taste, but it is very atmospheric and carries the game together with -  LOGAN CUNNINGHAM'S NARRATION . No surprises there. The music may be the soul of the game but the expert narration (and fantastic voice acting) are its heart. -  The DESIGN . The world of Transistor is original and colorful; the 'feel' is the same as in Bastion but it has a distinctly different theme; the result is stellar. -  CUSTOMIZATION . The ability to collect a variety of skills, all of them with different effects, depending on whether they are active, passive or modifying an active skill, makes for some interesting (and tough) choices as to how you want to play. Not everything works well but you can try everything.  Now to the things that I was less impressed with -   THE MEH  : -  The COMBAT SYSTEM . Sadly, it is nowhere near as great as (I) expected. Precision is not its strong point and those who were hoping for Frozen Synapse levels of refined tactical combat will be disappointed, as will be those that expected a slick Hack&amp;Slash. Some sections are almost impossible to beat with only one of the modes but intelligent use of both does not help in all situations and more often than not (especially later on), you can find yourself cheesing the game in less-than-fun ways when you encounter fights that are frustrating enough that you'd like to skip them, due to issues with -  The BALANCING . Few enemies are balls-to-the-wall hard, but many are insanely annoying. Having to deal with enemies who have the ability to cloak themselves (which, somehow, also makes them invulnerable) without the player having any way to disrupt this cloak (other than waiting for them to deal damage to you) or to damage them in cloak makes several mid- and endgame sections downright infuriating. Especially if said enemies are rapidly regenerating health. Several enemy attacks cannot be avoided and the player's ability to heal himself is extremely limited, making the whole combat system less a matter of skill and more one of a proper choice of abilities (which is where the combat system is at odds with its RPG elements); due to this, some fights (especially boss fights) and victories are anything but satisfying and can leave a bitter aftertaste. -  The CHARACTERS . While Bastion had only a few characters with little depth but strong-enough features to make them relatable and carry the story, Transistor has almost none. 'The voice' is the strongest one by far but remains a lot more blank than Bastion's narrator. The female lead, Red, has even less than that (or Bastion's Kid). The human antagonists are hardly characterized at all and what remains is a faceless menace that changes the world around you and attacks you constantly... and yet fails to really make you feel threatened. -  The STORY . Where Bastion's story was about a simple goal for most of the game (restoring the Bastion), Transistor lacks direction. You feel like a tourist who is being guided from one landmark to the other without any drive or ultimate goal behind it, which becomes even more apparent at the game's conclusion. The plot works with local tension only (i.e. short-term obstacles and goals). The lack of strong characters makes it hard to build-up a bad guy and the pace at which the city changes and the threat swallows it leaves no time to make you care about it or its inhabitants. Unlike the Bastion, you didn't build it with your own two hands and, despite being in a city, you never get a chance to interact with anybody. This leaves the romance as its only redeeming factor... except it isn't either, because the main characters' interaction is very one-sided. The sad truth is: Transistor's story is forgetable.   And finally -   THE BAD  : -  WORLD DESIGN (SCOPE AND DEPTH) . While the design is great, you hardly see anything of the city (or the rest of the world). Vistas are few and far between and the game doesn't feature any maps or background information that allows you to see the 'big picture'. Sadly, this devaluates most of the ingame biographies and what lore there is because it becomes that much harder to relate to for their lack of context. -  The ENDING . It certainly isn't Mass Effect 3 levels of terrible but, frankly, it makes no sense. The game's conclusion renders pretty much the entire hero's journey pointless and I have to ask what motivation Red had in the first place. That isn't to say that it isn't beautiful in several ways but nonetheless highly disappointing if you were hoping for a well-written story. -  The LENGTH . From what I have heard from several people, 7 hours is not a good time. It is quite possible to beat the game in under 5 hours. New Game+ may add replay value here, if you truly enjoyed the combat system and don't share my gripes with it, but if you don't, it leaves the question of value for your money. And, regardless of New Game+, my impression is that the game tries to do too much in too little time - Introducing you to a world, threatening this world and making you its involuntary savior has worked before... but it doesn't work for Transistor.    MY VERDICT:   (Or: tl;dr) Transistor is a good attempt to solve a task that was almost unsolvable - To create the next 'Bastion'. Design-wise, it is every bit as strong and a true treat for the eyes and ears, with some great ideas on how to keep progression interesting and your game experience unique.  But a closer look reveals a system that tries to combine real-time and tactical combat and, as a result, is the master of neither. The beautiful world that seems so full and interesting is a facade, a mere stage decoration with too little behind it to keep it from falling over when leaned on, leaving a lot of the ingame lore without sufficient context. And while music and narration are great, they cannot hide the fact that the play itself is boring and the characters forgotten as soon as they leave the stage. Supergiant Games gave their game and its world too little time to introduce themselves and captivate you and the result is all the more disappointing for it.  Nevertheless, I recommend Transistor for the interesting experience it is; you may find the combat system and story, despite their flaws, more satisfying than I did and, either way, you do not want to miss out on the soundtrack and Logan Cunningham's sexy voice. Supergiant Games deserves the money for a brave attempt, even if this attempt falls short.  If you aren't dying to play Transistor right now, pick it up once it goes on sale.",1,0

That's not me being spiteful or anything either, because I loved TDU1 on PSP and PS2.  It's mostly technical issues. Thankfully, the game does support controllers, although not automatically; you have to enable this from the settings.  The first thing you'll notice upon booting up the game is that it only runs in windowed mode. F11 and the maximise button did not fix this, and although there was an option to change the resolution in the settings, there was no fullscreen option. I'm not sure if it's me being mad, but full games running in windowed mode tend to result in choppier framerates, and that was certainly the case here.  Then we have the car handling itself. The tiniest of braking will send you spinning out of control for no reason whatsoever. It makes the game unplayable. It was the same in both the high-end Ferrari care the game teases you with in the beginning (which was really just slow and spinny), and with the starter car you buy.  Furthermore, when in first person mode the mouse sensitivity is extremely slow, even when set to the highest possibility in the settings.  I would advise against buying.",-1,0

269490,Bardbarian,"'Bardbarian' is a kind-of tower defense game with the towers being minions that you can spawn around you.

In addition, you get an awesome catchy Metal theme, cute graphics, lots of upgrades to purchase and the additional game modes Endless and Escape. All in all an awesome deal of many fun hours for a cheap price (especially when reduced).

245170,Skullgirls 2nd Encore,"Skullgirls is...an interesting fighter to be sure of, and I don't know how to really declare my stance on it.  On one hand this is a very 'fluid' fighter, every attack has a large amount of frames of animation, there's a lot of small details in movements and actions, every input 'feels' like it has weight behind it. It also has things set up to 'prevent' a lot of things that seem to plauge fighters of both yesterday and today (Justace, Jojo ABS, and MvC3 being the current examples of writing.) and to try to encorage more 'dynamic' fighting.  ...On the other hand this game kinda 'forces' you to learn long strongs of attacks and very selectivly timed inputs to get 'garenteed' damage, with most even low-mid level fights being desided by two connecting hits leading towards said combos. It also has a very limited roster, meaning you'll chances are see all the tricks in the book in a very short time.  it want's to try to welcome new people into fighters, but it seems to cater more towards those who have been doing fighters for a long time...thought in turn, seems to not be 'enough' for them to sink their teeth into and feel gimped by the experance. This is in no way a 'bad' game, but it sits in a very akward placement where one has to ask: If you try to please everyone, will you in the end please no one?",1,0

Well these guys dont give any useful feedback to its community, promoted the game via streamers/youtubers and got the game spoiled..japanese release was way earlier and yet the game was launched with problems and no patch are nowhere to be seen without mention they would change the requiriments frequently..they rose the prices in several regions..more than once in some of them, I got banned from bandai facebook for asking a satisfaction on those matters and i was NOT rude..matter of fact I was very polite  ",-1,0

This game is pretty much the same with a few new additions, and it delivers the same experience but with full compatibility with Windows 10 and full HD. I recommend this game because I loved then and I still love it. This a budget game thought, so it's pretty basic and doesnt provide much of a challenge. Is all about making an hotel, dominate the market and make millions of dollars. I did it once with a chain of motels in Hotel Giant and I'm very excited in doing the same in Hotel Giant 2.",1,0

276810,Mordheim: City of the Damned,ORIGINAL COMMENT:  This is not Mordheim. It is a Mordheim-esque game. The interface feels like a bad console port and seems to expect the player to want to use a control isntead of a keyboard and mouse.  REVISED COMMENT:  As the game is now out of Early Access it is fair to update this (and I said I would so...)  This still isn't Mordheim. I cannot marry the Warband generation with the rulebook nor can I marry the other mechanics. As a Skaven player I expect to start the game with hordes of cheap rats and slings.  While there is still a very console port feeling the controls are much improved. It felt like keyboard and mouse was a serious consideration for the UI/UX team and the small niggling predefined defaults (which will vary from individual to individual) can be easily remapped.  With the core of the game still not being Mordheim I am still unwilliing to recommend the game.,-1,0

206440,To the Moon,"A fun little game with moments that will really make you think about all sorts of moments in a person's life(possibly your own). This game has a very intricate story backed by a very memorable soundtrack that creates the perfect atmosphere for all the situations you find the main characters getting into as you progress through the story with them(You'll be sure to come back for more for those sweet tunez). Another strong suit of the game are the characters that you meet, they are very fleshed out as well as have very attachable personalities to say the least.   ''So what else is great about this game?'' or perhaps you're thinking,''What about the negatives?'' you might say. Well, I would say there's not much else that is needed for a small title like this in terms of positives and looking back at the journey that you go through, I honestly can't think of any major negatives but a small thing that's needs to be mentioned is that there keys used to move around honestly feel weird at times so I found myself just clicking to move the character in smaller spaced areas.   All in all a very strong game with a very moving soundtrack, I would fully recommend to any whole hearted gamer looking for a beautiful story laced full of emotion and depth that will definitely get you thinking.   My Rating is an honest 9.5/10.",1,0

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Great game, even though the software is incredibly terrible at times (mainly GTA Online).  - Online lobbies aren't servers, they're peer-to-peer connections. As a result, cheating is an issue and is harder to address. You're connecting to players: a player in Asia will have a terrible connection to you, causing their character (and NPC assets that have/could interact with them) to glitch around and lag to you.  - On occaison you will disconnect from the other players in the session, kicking you into your own lobby. Yes, this can happen while playing with friends.  - Alt + F4 does not hard-crash the game (like it should). It puts you into a pause menu asking you to confirm you want to quit.  - If you get shot at in an online lobby, and you are in the pause menu, it kicks you out of the pause menu, which can be irritating when trying to change settings/leave a lobby in which you are being spawnkilled. - 'Free' DLC: It's blocked by a paywall of ingame money. Rockstar has made over $500 million off of the in-game microtransactions. The newer cars they've added with pricetags of $2.5m ingame cost an equivalent of $40 USD. The Finance and Felony content update requires you to have a CEO office (min price of $1m ingame) and a warehouse (~$200k iirc). - Most of the future content updates are gta online only. New supercars, lowriders, only exist in online.   With that being said, the singleplayer game is worth the $60 on its own.",1,0

255710,Cities: Skylines,"Whoah... This game is amazing. I'm not sure if I can put it into words or not, but I'll try.  Background: I've played a few City Simulators over time, I started back with Sim City 2000, went to 4, and eventually to 2013 or Sim City '5.' All of those were great games. I even enjoyed 2013, sort of. I never really got into it though. To start, I had problems even getting my game to activate, and of course there was the whole always online thing. But I'm here to talk about Cities: Skylines.  Probably one of the best games I've ever played. Tons of little minute details that, if they weren't all together, might not make a huge deal. But they add up. Like being able to name every last and single thing in the game. From pigs to buildings to districts. You can just follow around a few people and watch what they do. You can see the little animations. In general, the gameplay is great. Very interesting and fun. You can do so much! You have the options of whether or not you want to micromanage everything, or just roll with some of it. You can get pretty into some areas, lilke budgets and taxes. You get to decide how everything should be layed out, from roads, to electricity, to even, somewhat annoying at times, water pipes.  Now, one of its greatest achievements over Sim City is that it is fully integrated to the Steam workshop. There are thousands of addons already. Even one of the old Maxis guys came over to start making models. Personally, I'm already running some mods. I like to be free to customize the game anyway I like, and Cities: Skylines does just that. Its just a few days after the release and the mods have already blown me away. I can't wait to see what else will come.  Now, with every game, there is always some bad. First of all, the driving AI is a little unimpressive at times. Sometimes, the drivers just won't make a smart decision and avoid the traffic. They all go by shortest route, not shortest time. The water pipes get pretty annoying at times. I wish they were just in the roads, at first they're fun, but eventually its just busy work. However, it is helpful to be able to run the pipes seperately sometimes. Perhaps a feature to auto lay the pipes with roads at times, and seperately during others. Electricity can feel the same way, but to a much lesser extent. The custom lines for transportation are the same way. Its great to be able to run a special route, but sometimes you don't want to, so it ends up being busy work. Both good and bad. There could definetly be a larger variety of buildings as well, I've yet to see a few different types I'd like to see.   Stuff I'd like to see added: Multiplayer, to cooperate with friends. Sell services and resources, like in Sim City. Upgrades to buildings, so I don't have to build a brand new school to hold more students, I can add a new classroom instead. Larger variety of buildings One way four lane roads. Larger variety of industry specializations. (High tech, etc)   Overall, if you're thinking of getting this game, get it. Its definetly worth it. The modding community pretty much adds everything, not to mention the devs are amazing. Pretty sure this is going to be one of the greatest games ever made. IMO, it already is. Its definetly worth $30, the devs deserve every last penny. I'd give the game an 8.5/10.",1,0
206190,Gunpoint,"Gunpoint is an interesting indie take on the stealth game genre, using clever gadgets and a unique jumping mechanic you must navigate your somewhat idiotic and incredibly sarcastic private eye around the level to hack computers then escape. The entire game can be played non lethally but it is much more fun to kick doors onto people or jump on them from the ceiling and knock them down.

200370,A Game of Dwarves,"This is an absolutely fantastic little game. You're a Dwarf Prince, who is given control of a group of dwarves, and you build fortresses and caves underground and fight bad things who want to kill you. You go searching for materials to build furniture and decorations, and to advance your dwarven army. Once you kill the bad things, you can steal their beds and bunny rabbits and stuff to put in your fortress.  There is a campaign mode with quests which I think is really well done, and great to play. There's also a sandbox 'free' mode so you can build your ultimate fortress without any distractions. In both sandbox and campaign, I love being able to decorate my little dwarven fortress.. thing. There's a whole range of decorations and things to do, and discover.   Killing stuff and making a badass army isn't bad either, theres a fair few enemies and bosses to defeat with your military dwarves.  Theres a skill tree type doohickey that will allow you to give your group of dwarves more powers and items as the game goes on.  It's a great game to play casually and relax with (if you learn not to try and rush through, which made lead to stress and death unless you're quite focused!).   Sometimes your dwarves don't do quite what they're told, plus they're fat so they get stuck behind furniture a lot and then panic and die of starvation.. but it's okay, you can just spawn another one.   I definitely recommend it. It might take a tiny while to get used to (at least, it did me) but once you're there, it's quite addictive. One thing though - Apart from the DLC, there is an in game 'shop' to use your steam wallet to buy yet more decorations. The packs in there arnt expensive, and I think anyone who enjoys building/decorating/creating things like I do will be happy to pick them up for the price they are.. but if that sort of thing annoys you, well.. it's here.",1,0

18700,And Yet It Moves,This is a super creative and downright fun game but unfortunately it is over way way way to soon. It is only 10 bucks or so on the virtual console so it is well worth a purchase and play-through especially if you like plat-formers but at the end of the day it falls short of truly being a brilliant game. This is a plat-former where you don't move the character but instead you move the world around the character!! that's a bit of a lie as your character can run and jump but that's it. This opens up all sorts of fun and clever puzzles that make you think. The game can also become pretty challenging but it is just too short. The graphics are super stylized and fit the wii perfectly. I recommend this game to anybody but i just wish it were a full fledged game.,-1,0

380360,Tap Tap Infinity,"My personal experience with this game is, even if I have not played it for too long is that it's way to much like clicker heroes, no wait, hear me out, I have been a die hard fan of cookie clicker, and played that for a couple of years, and then came clicker heroes, which uses a similiar but different formula making it feel a bit fresher (although by now I don't even spend much time in clicker heroes other than bying heroes trying to get all achivements before I can quit). and here come tap tap infinity. A game which is exactly like clicker heroes, save some differences but not enough of them to make me feel like it's something fresh and new, but more like ah, I have done this before, boss at every fifth?, hp instead of timers but the same deal (this is not fresh), and so I played and hoped for something new but no, gold, chests, heroes, hero abilities, % , 'spells' and of the few I got is basicly the same as the ones in clicker heroes.  although the graphics are in 3d and the bosses are your future heroes, with including text boxes everywhere trying to create a story by making you clicking to get the story to move on (which halts gameplay), ofc it's all according to your taste.

218620,PAYDAY 2,"PAYDAY 2 is a first-person shooter game developed by OVERKILL. PAYDAY 2 is the next installment after PAYDAY: The Heist.  PAYDAY 2, unlike the previous game, has many improvements, upgrades and changes in the gameplay. You don't just blaze your way around to rob a store or bank, drilling the vault and escape. You need more strategy and planning in PAYDAY 2, which also make stealth approach as an option, and sometimes a primary option for most heist. Doing stealth is not easy, but you get bonuses for doing stealth. Teamwork are more encouraged in PAYDAY 2, especially on stealth approach. As a matter of fact, you will need to work together on stealth heist.  The police in PAYDAY 2 are more vary and some are even powerful, as some of them are technically not police, but FBI task force. In lower difficulties you may only meet the police and SWAT team, but in higher difficulties, FBI are your primary enemies. Dozer, cloaker, tazer, shield, they are making a return in PAYDAY 2.  The upgrade system in PAYDAY 2 has also been changed and improved. Unlike PAYDAY: The Heist, you can choose skill tree and perks you prefer the most in PAYDAY 2 and has to focus on that as you cannot become everything, you have to be something for your crew. If you prefer stealth approach, you need to focus on the right skill tree like ghost, or if you like shooting people around, you could be an enforcer. Each skill tree has unique bonus, weapon skill and special equipment, but you are limited with what you are.  Weapons in PAYDAY 2 are also more customizable, barrel, scope or sight, stock, magazine, laser sight and more. You can customize your weapons to suit your skill tree and perks, or just customize them to be something you prefer. Mask can also now be customized with patterns or colors to make yourself unique among other criminals.  Graphics of PAYDAY 2 is far better than the previous, more detailed and more beautiful. With masks and weapons customization system and detailed models, they look so beautiful, making the gameplay so epic and making your customization even more unique. PAYDAY 2 performances are also good, despite sometimes I tend to crash.  In the latest update, PAYDAY 2 introduced microtransactions system similar to those in CS:GO and Dota 2, despite the promises that there will be never a microtransactions in PAYDAY 2. The weapon skin on PAYDAY 2 have differenced however, as some rare skin includes stats bonuses.  Overall PAYDAY 2 is awesome, I recommend this so much.  Rating 9/10",1,1

383690,Mu Complex,"The description of a command line style hacking game was an automatic hook for me. I really like the hacking theme and have tried several types.   Apparently this is based on linux style commands, but even with no experience I had no trouble navigating menus. There is tab completion for most of the commands and files for ease of use. The soundtrack basically consists of long tones followed by more long tones, so I recommend muting it. The game comes with two 'episodes' to complete. My playtime for episode 1 was about an hour and four hours for episode 2. I enjoyed that you had to use outside tools to complete the puzzles. Don't be afraid to use screencaps, google, or software to help with the puzzles. The storyline is pretty straightforward, but if you dig a little deeper there are a few easter eggs. Looking through the achievements I definitely missed a few things so I will probably go back for them.   Great game for less than $10.",1,0

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"Initially I was really unhappy with Rockstar over this game.. the performance of it was terrible but that's changed for the good a fair bit since those dark days. (not that it's amazingly better now but it is definitely good enough, I can start recommending it to other people).  THE GOOD : --------------  * Open World - Heaps to do (more on this later)  * Interactive and enguaging city (you feel like another citizen and people respond to your actions in a 'normal' way.. except police who replaced their stock of handcuffs with 9mm ammo.. least their prison is fairly empty :p)  * Single Player is lots of fun and provides enough mini-games that you could technically enjoy it for a VERY long time before getting bored.. some mini-games feel formulated 'Talk to NPC, kill target, get paid' whilst others are very much unique to this.  * Multiplayer is really starting to come into its stride now where players can headline their own faction within the city as a VIP. Players can own a large variety of awesome properties including a customisable Yacht!  * There are plenty of missions a player can do in GTA Online (GTA O) which will not require them to enter a special context menu and load up a private, mini-session which means NO MORE LOADING SCREENS if you prefer to enjoy the in-session ones.  * Mouse and Keyboard input has been improved significantly to the point where you can actually play this game competitively .. it really does feel more like playing Battlefield inside a huge city at times with all the cover tactics etc. 3rd person takes away from this a little but also is nice that players have options.. your play style won't feel limited by input variety and camera options :)  I could go on there are tons more good but that'll do for now, the rest would just be more details on specific things such as exploring and finding cool hide-out areas etc.  ----------------------  THE BAD : -----------  * There are still some memory issues when running this game from non-SSD harddrives where you get loading FPS lock-ups and the progressive downward spiral of memory leaking that eventually (day or 2 of off-and-on gaming) will require a computer restart. But ... you should probably be restarting your pc around that often normally if you want to maintain healthy levels of updates and a nice clean cache etc.  * There are still a fair few missions that take place within these Mini-Sessions (a session inside a session). These Private Session missions impose loading screens and also have Minimum/maximum player requirements.. trying to get 4 players to do the same heist as you and not leave mid way through because of something as fickle such as ..' you didn't let me drive so i'm out'. which means you have 3/4 of the required players and the mission auto-fails.  They need to get rid of minimum and maximum player requirements for heists and missions if they want people to even consider doing them as a way to earn cash because it's sooo painful having missions auto-fail due to a poor connection on one of the squad members or them just having a hissy fit.. or worse trolls that join and then leave right before the objective completes.  * GTA Online (GTA O) is not hosted by Rockstar, they use P2P technology so you might actually wind up the host of your GTA O session lol.. lag can be a problem at times due to this when you get guys from Russia joining an Aussie hosted server with a few Americans in there.  * There is no way to store weapons in your apartments so when you buy any weapons .. you are stuck with them for life in GTA O, which means that after some time playing.. testing out new arrivals .. you start to carry the entire stock of Ammunation in your back pocket.. which is fine until you get a guy who is attacking from a long range and you're on the wrong assault rifle so you have to toggle through till you reach the one that has good long range etc.  It would be good if they let you select what weapons to carry and what to keep in your apartment.  * Unable to buy and sell on the Stock Market at the moment (I believe this is meant to be coming to GTA O along with Casinos)  * GTA O appears to encourage the purchase of Shark Cards for in game cash so players can avoid the painful Heists which were meant to be the big way to earn cash in game. If you don't have 3 friends willing to do heists with you .. prepare for a world of pain because trying to get 3 randoms to stay, who can actually play.. and speak the same language .. it's rare.   ------------------------------  NEUTRAL POINTS TO NOTE : --------------------------------  * As mentioned the game tries to direct players into buying Shark Cards for real money to gain GTA O currency without working for it. Hackers also have a habbit of joining sessions and dropping money bags on your head which provide in game currency without working for it. Since both achieve the same goal and Rockstar are comfortable with handing out In Game Cash that requires no mission completion or skill work to obtain it in game.. I see no difference to hackers doing something that has the same end result.  Rockstar are not taking money from Shark Cards and using it to provide Dedicated Hosting, they are not fully addressing all of the Memory Leak issues that have been with the game since launch on PC, they are not porting the game over to MAC for those unfortunate few who own a macintosh (may you rest in peace), but heck they deserve to at least play the game too right... owning a MAC should be punishment enough. Rockstar are still focussing a lot on trying to find new money sinkholes in game so players with cash run out and have to start buying Shark Cards.. that's the only motivation for new and hyper expensive things like the Yachts but I can't fault them there.. and the content is nice.. IF you can afford it.  The Heists and other negative points I listed are indicators that this is a game where you shouldn't be buying Shark Cards to support the continuation of previously listed negative points.  * Hackers.. well yeah sooo the Hacker Giveth and the Hacker Taketh away... Not all hackers are friendly and give you all guns, raining money on you and inventing new gamemodes such as Armageddon (we had a hacker shooting jumbo jets from a minnigun over the city and we had to try survive .. it was so much fun) You do get a few who will attach a UFO to your head, Mass Kill the entire Session using different players to commit the act on their behalf forcibly.. it will say that PLAYER X (coul be you) killed.. and then the entire session list rolls up the screen. Newer players then think YOU are the hacker. until it says they killed everyone too at which point it becomes obvious you will not know who the hacker is.  I say hackers are neutral because yeah there is good .. heaps of good .. but there is the bad were you get some who want to ruin the fun and troll. The worst hackers are the ones who hack HP etc and pretend that they're just too good until they Face Tank Rockets (plural) and you call them on their $#!t... haven't seen too many like that recently though which is nice :)  * Voice Chat : It's great when you want to chat with other players in your faction/friends list etc.. but the default setting is Everyone soooo lot of nooobs talking over public channel .. can get pretty uncomfortable at times or just plain annoying.. luckily you can mute individual players if you so desire.. or you can switch your Chat mode from Everyone to another more suitable setting... it just takes knowing how.  well that's a fairly good coverage of main points good, bad and neutral so hopefully that helps explain why I think the game is worth buying now.",1,0

Of all three of the Deponia games, this is the one that had the most frustratingly illogical/plot-holey puzzles, and a really hideously racist joke/setup in one part that was just reeealllly not cool. But I stuck with it, because I totally fell in love with this world and its characters over the course of the series. But then that ending -- what a disappointment. After the story treads water in chapter after chapter of meaningless, disconnected puzzles, to spend seemingly so little time and effort on that ending, it just felt kind of lazy. The series as a whole deserved better, IMO. Play it to get series closure, and some interesting story developments, but don't expect the sort of culmination this story deserves. 7/10.",-1,0

476920,Amulet of Dreams,"In this Hidden Object/casual adventure game you play as a boy, Aiden, who wants to rescue Alison and to do this, you have to solve various kinds of puzzles in multiple worlds. The puzzles range from object combining to hidden object to some simple logic puzzles.  The various locations are beautifully illustrated with limited animation on most screens, and in the hidden object parts everything is correctly labelled and can actually be found. There is some voice acting, which is reasonably well done. It's not professional but doesn't distract either. Rounding out the presentation is a relaxing music soundtrack and some effect sounds.  The major downside of this game is that it relies on 'moon logic'. On multiple occasions I had absolutely no idea what to do or where to go next, even with the assist of the in-game map. At these times I simply had to use the built-in help to proceed and even with this, it wasn't always clear exactly why something worked that way. Making it worse, a few of the puzzle solutions do not make any kind of sense. Why can't I cut vines with a sword I already have in my inventory, for example, but I must use another cutting object found elsewhere?  There is quite a lot of backtracking in this game, even across the various worlds, so you'll either need to be very persistent in trying every single object everywhere, or regularly rely on the help function like I had to.  There is also some inconsistency in the story. Aiden and Alison are referred to at friends at certain points, and as siblings at other points. The story also ends rather suddenly without any epilogue or other kind of aftermath.  These gripes do not make it bad game, though. The overall experience I had was a good one, and the game does not contain any scary moments so it is also suitable for very young players. However, since it does rely on a lot of obtuse logic in places, I can /only/ recommend this to die-hard Hidden Object / Casual Adventure fans who aren't annoyed by getting stuck,",1,0
275850,No Man's Sky,"As most of the reviews for this game have been negative because of the issue's opening and playing the game, i feel like i should write that i haven't actually had any issues with opening the game. I think half the problem is that people brought this game, after mounting the hype train, and expected something completely different from what they actually recieved. I think you have to give the deveopers some credit, they were very ambitious about the game they wanted to create.   When i started to play the game i got a bit bored of the moving backwards and forwards looking for parts to travel to the next solar system... It started to be a little bit of a repetative grind. But then the story started kicking off, and the game actually starting having a context, and then you could choose whether to move forward or to go and explore. Lets be honest, we've been given everything that was promised. I haven't had any issues running the game. (nvidia 980, i5 pro)   I'll end on this. If you're looking for a game where you want to explore, in space, mining materials to upgrade your ship, refuel parts of the ship, learning alien languages, being attacked cause you have 100,000 units worth in gold, selling and buying things, exploring different space stations and habitats on plants, then buy this game.

Where they get the items from MUST be hacking, or (when you could port worlds) porting. This made it easy and yet STILL FUN. My PC Experience: Spawn in, get killed because of the corruption, then rain, THEN nightfall. and you might be wondering why. This PC version runs on a Partly broken, Fully reliant, clunky Server Client. In servers, I can compare Minecraft and Terraria. Both have broken clients, but Minecraft can join servers and Terraria can't.THIS means (If you want the console experience) you have to either get lucky and see if it works, or download TerrariViewer (Most sites are still viruses and surveys).

The people who bought the Completely Overkill pack knew it was a gamble. They gambled anyway. Now they have to deal with what they got.

Great, you're benefitting from it unless you're 25-100 already where even then IT STILL WONT AFFECT YOU.

The graphics are pleasant but gameplay feels restrictive.  The main reason i've posted this review is for the following:  If you came here looking for a Dungeon Keeper fix then...

360380,Tiny Bridge: Ratventure,"I got this game for next to nothing in a sale, free after selling the cards.. I didn't have high expectations but I was still left feeling really disappointed with it.  The biggest problem I had with it is the physics, given that it's a physics game it's a real issue for the game when the main aspect of the game just fails. It feels a bit too 'bouncy', like the wood is made out of rubber, no matter how much support you add, all your structure/bridge wants to do is wobble, flail around and isn't able to stay firmly in one place. You can copy a hint, 100% to how it's shown and still not be able to do the level..In most cases the hint shown is the only solution to solve the level. Little creativity can be done; making it really dull.  I think the biggest frustration I had with the game and made me abandon it was that if you did a test run and then ended it the contraption doesn't 'pause', it still keeps the same momentum it had before leaving it to break even in construction mode. As it's still able to move during this phase it leaves it being a pain in the ♥♥♥ to build, you can fail before you even start testing it. It's irritating and a buggy mess.  There's so many bridge construction games out there which are much better off than this, it had a nice idea but the game is just poorly made.  Not worth buying it but you can get it for nothing when it gets a high discount, the bundle it's included in has some nice games though but don't expect any enjoyment from Tiny Bridge: Ratventure.",-1,0

39210,FINAL FANTASY XIV Online,"Like Final Fantasy? Like MMO's? Then get this. Fun game overall, a few bugs here and there where sometimes NPC's don't spawn/load in to interact with them in order to finish a quest but a relog fixes that and your progress is still saved so not a big issue.  Not much to say, if you know Final Fantasy then you know what this game is like; minus the turn-based combat in favor of a more mainstream MMORPG combat system with ability hotkeys in real time instead.  Dungeons can prove an issue once you hit level 15+ as finding the right roles at the right time is near impossible on unpopulated realms, so unless you don't mind waiting for hours to get the minimum team of a Healer, Tank, and 2 DPS then make sure you have some friends to fill those roles in. (The game sets that as a locked minimum so until you have that full team you can't enter)  8.5/10 Would recommend if you're a fan of MMORPG's The ability to learn and change between any class at anytime (once you hit level 15+ and get access to the other 2 realms) is a nice change, much akin to Trove but minus the pay to unlock and need for a Class Station to change. You can even bind the different class weapons to hotkeys which change the class, as well as automatically equipping the set loadout for that class within a second.   Only downside; you WILL need friends to play this with to get far as needing a full team for dungeons does become an issue, but if you don't mind waiting or just being a Field character and skilling instead of combat, then pay no heed.",1,0

449040,Jesus Christ RPG Trilogy,"  This is an extremely light-hearted and fun RPG, similar to Earthbound.    Seriously. Earthbound is all I can think about while I play this game. Regardless, Jesus Christ RPG Trilogy is a set of 3 role playing games based around the life of Jesus of Nazareth. As a Christian I find this game very interesting, light hearted, and even with it's some-what ridiculous jokes and modern references, not at all offensive.  The JC games have a well implemented 'turned based' combat system, meaning you and your allies attack, then your enemy and their allies attack. The visuals aren't mind-blowing, but this isn't a problem as the game is designed to imitate a 90's RPG game, once again similar to Earthbound.  This game is very fun, cute, corny and very humorous, I do enjoy playing JC RPG Trilogy very much, and I do intend to play this game a lot more.  Please play this game. It's free-to-play, it's very decent in scope and aspiration, that deserves some love. Surely the fact we have another kid-friendly game on Steam is something also worth praise.",1,1

234190,Receiver,"This is a great game, and I highly recommend it.  It's really immersive and challenging, with a perma-death system that makes it very addictive. The scarcity of resources and the difficult combat both give the game this kind of survival-horror feel, but without jump-scares and through atmosphere instead. Unless you count the *beep* sound of a kill-drone locking onto you as a jump-scare, which you might by the end of a session.   The controls are difficult to get used to, but it feels more realistic than traditional shooters. You're in complete control of every part of the gun, and fumbling under pressure while a tazerbot is flying toward you, getting ready to murder your face off, has this very authentic terror to it. In many ways, it feels more like an actual simulation of how well I personally would do under a similar situation rather than a video game, and it is very rewarding when your able to reload, shoot down 2 tazerbots and a turret, and reload again, all through muscle-memory without the help guide.  The atmosphere in this game is thick enough to cut with a knife, and I really enjoyed getting immersed in the story and setting while listening tapes from another Receiver. I was facinated by all the amazing things the tapes talked about, and found the more meta tapes especially entertaining. They are also very effective at invoking various emotions, especially after you've collected a few tapes and the transmission is becomming less and less corrupted. The desperate struggle of you as one of the few survivors of the Mind-Kill is palpable, and the tapes gave a small feeling of hope as I searched desperately for more ammo and flashlights. The game is very good at drawing you in, and I'm so glad to see video game developers actually exploring the possibilities of their media, and not make the same games over and over again with less depth but prettier lighting.  I highly recommend Receiver, and I feel as many people as possible should experience it. 10/10, would Receive again!",1,0

211420,DARK SOULS™: Prepare To Die Edition,"This game isn't 'technically' hard. What's hard about this game, is there's no way to progress through it unless you memorize. Memorize enemies' attacks, strategies, placement of enemies in the level, etc YOu die over and over, not only because you made a bad move, but because in many situations, depending on your experience level, and how your character is prepared, you must play a situation out a certain way. No, you're not going into a room with five enemies and fighting all of them at once. And I really wanted a game like that, I really did. But this game is ridiculous. Even if you have two enemies with reasonably strong attacks, and you're not very experienced, you're a dead man. You MUST lure then out one by one. NO, GAMES SHOULDN'T BE LIKE THAT. Memorization my friends, that's all this game is... memorization. How many times did you die saying ok, i make a right here, and there is a ghost in this room to the left, then go forward and reverse to kill the one behind me, then two more appear to front left and right, go down stairs and another will be in front of the door way.......... Go through this cave, make a right, go up the ladder, enemy to the left and right, up a couple more ladders, dart spitters on right, run all the way to.... NO, GAMES SHOULDN'T BE LIKE THIS!!! GAMES AREN'T MEANT TO BE PROGRESSED BY MEMORIZATION. THE GAME IS HARD, BECAUSE THE GAME MECHANICS ARE CHEAP AND WONKY AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT HARD. YOU LITERALLY HAVE TO BE CHEAP WHEN STARTING OUT TO PROGRESS.  Want even the littlest amount of instruction on what areas you 'should' be going to because your'e a novice, unlike these herbs with 500 hours of gameplay? Never. The NPC's never give you a hint as to what to do. They told me to go to new londo after ringing the first bell. Actually, New Londo should come after Blighttown (which should be the area you go to after ringing the first bell) because unless you kill the NPC (o wait, i thought I wasn't supposed to kill npc's wtf) on top of a building in New Londo to get a key, you must complete Blighttown AND complete Sens fortress before New Londo. Now Why the flock would the NPC tell me to go to New Londo?????? Play in Dark Root Garden and have no issue? O, but when you go up a long ladder to the other side of DRG, no, those enemies are hard as hell. The boss there? Yea ok, not when you're a novice on level 43 soul level (no I don't read google and understand what is the 'best way ' to play unlike all these other herbs out there who are soul level 10 with ridiculous weapon customizations. Completely makes the game not fun when you're invaded by someone like this. O wait, you can be invaded even when you're trying to fight 3 other enemies. I was in dark root garden fighting two npc's one of them a ghost, and i got invaded. Yea, like im going to win that wtf.   This game sucks and I'm going to tell you why. Without warning, players can enter your world in an attempt to gain humanity. The problem is, the game pairs up players with 'like' soul levels, not by hours of play, not by anything else. You could have someone with 300 hours on this game playing against someone with literally 10 hours because the person with 300 hours total has started a new character thats only up to level 10, knows exactly how to use theirsouls wisely, and completely take advantage of the other player's lack of experience. Their weapons are leveled up to the balls while I'm sitting here trying to learn and i get stomped. wtf. O I'm sorry, I have a life and i'm trying to enjoy this game. Sorry it isn't my life. I want a f'ing refund. No where did it say you will get invaded and can't turn that feature off. 'O, but you can just stay hollow the entire game'. Uhm wait a minute, novices need help with bosses and the only way you're getting help, is you guessed it...   Game mechanics are junk. JUmp? There is no jump button, you have to run and press the run button again to jump, and it's extremely wonky. Back stabs? O I'm sorry, I didn't know you couldn't hold FORWARD on the analog stick while trying to backstab. Even when you don't do that, it doesn't work frequently enough to pisss you off.  Clipping galore man. I can't say how many times the camera swooped past me becaue I was against a wall and i got killed. How about getting caught literally on nothing and not being able to move?   The only thing cool about this game is theory behind the game mechanics. poorly executed in my mind. I wish the game had more polish, more attention to controls.... You get a cheap game with cheap development.   Story line? What story line. There is no story line. RPG? This isnt an RPG, sorry. YOu don't talk to people and get information. YOu talk to people to do one thing (buy, upgrade, fix weapons, armor, magic), that's it. NO information whatsoever. Sorry, but just because you can 'level up' doesn't make it an RPG. It's an action/adventure game at best. RPG's are 'role' based, there is no 'role' here. You walk around aimlessly not knowing wtf to do.   Map? you dont' get a map.",-1,0

362960,Tyranny,"Probably the best, most compelling single-player fantasy rpg I have played in years. If you're looking for a story-driven game where your choices can help shape what happens, Tyranny is your game.  Is it perfect? No. The pause-and-issue-orders combat style can seem a bit cluttered and clunky at times; the level of inventory management might seem tedious to those not familiar with classic-style rpgs; you and your companions start out relatively weak combatants, and have to grow into power; and I still can't figure out why the default zoom couldn't have moved in even closer than it does.  But, for me, the few flaws in the game do not matter -- they pale in comparison to all the things Tyranny gets right.  This is true story game, one that pulled me in, and refused to let go of my imagination. The choice-and-consequence system is the best I've seen yet -- rather than second-guessing what developers might deem a Good or Evil act, the game keeps choices relative -- and actions have consequences.  Win Favor with one faction and its people through your words and deeds, and you may incur the Wrath of another faction. Or multiple factions.  Your companions may stay with you because they're Loyal, or because they've learned to Fear your power. Both motivations will require something from you.  My only true complaint about Tyranny after 60+ hours of play, is that I wish there were more of it.  The ending seemed somewhat abrupt, after all the moment-to-moment adventuring which brought me there -- the consequences of my final actions and choices were played out through a series of title cards describing and depicting what came next.  I was so engrossed in the game by this point, I would've rather have played through these events for myself, rather than read about them in summary.  But I loved this game. It's companion characters became true personalities in my mind, who will remain in memory, alongside our adventures.  As above, the only thing I was truly left wanting was ... more.  Absolutely recommended for those who might be interested.   (Random Tip: Invest in Lore skill, no matter what you play -- it reflects your knowledge of your world and its customs)",1,0

Usually I don't play into the cards of dickish ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥s by reacting to their BS but you can't always be silent about such ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t or else these mofos think they've won.   The game itself is moderately challenging, up to the extent of demanding close to perfect mastering/exploiting the mechanics when it comes to getting all stars on the time attack tracks. The mechanics during regular levels range from simple over ♥♥♥♥ move to clever.

204360,Castle Crashers,"// Castle Crashers a 2D Platform Indie Beat 'em Up : // // Schuitje82 - Extended Review //   About this game: ============= I really enjoy this game from the beginning when it came out on another platform. It has a super great and funny story line that makes this one great adventure. Graphics looks amazing and the themes are well through of. You play through the levels to save the 4 princesses from the evil kings. This may sound a bit boring ? but on the contrary, the game has a very nice story. You bash and shoot your way through levels and woop everything in your way. Discover new land, animals, weapons and much much more.    Core Gameplay: ============ You can choose in the beginning the 4 basic characters from the game. These are Fire, Toxic, Ice and Electric Castle Crashers. All of these have there own special powers you can throw at your enemies. You have a level up system so that makes it extra addicting to play this game. And you can choice how you like to upgrade you character as you wish. You give more points to magic you will unlock new skills. Or try to be strong as the hulk and place the points on strength. You can discover new animals they will give you more power health, XP or just find things for you. After all these finding animals and leveling your character. You can also find new weapons and give this a extra twist to your character. What is cool about every weapon is that it haves his own stats that will give you sometime extra like, speed, strength or magic powers so an extra advantage to you character so it’s not about the weapons looks it’s what stats you will need because of the play style you choose.   Overall: ====== This games has some amazing soundtracks and levels. Play these with your friends online and offline. Enjoy and fall in love with this great Beat 'm Up !!  Personally I give it a 10/10 score !!!   http://store.steampowered.com/app/204360    == For more reviews go to  www.gamegrin.com  == == Please don't forget to like my reviews ==",1,1

221640,Super Hexagon,"This is a great game. It's a slightly abstract game that follows the recent trend of 'harder than balls' gaming, i.e. Super Meat Boy or Flappy Bird (although it is far superior in gameplay to the latter). The gameplay consists of navigating an arrow around a hexagon to avoid shapes, which sounds a little boring -- okay, a LOTtle boring, but it really isn't -- the techno-like music and almost dance-like movement of your fingers as they perfectly navigate the hardest difficulty level with ease makes this the perfect way to show off to a pal who is skeptical of your utter mastery. I repeat, this is a great game, and at the price of literally less than a sandwich, there is no excuse not to buy this game.",1,0

244450,Men of War: Assault Squad 2,"'Men of War: Assault Squad 2' kontynuacja gry Men of War: Assault Squad to gra w mojej ocenie dobra. Grało mi się bardzo przyjemnie, jednak po przejściu kampanii np: amerykańskiej, gdy brałem się za serię misji niemieckich strasznie przeszkadzała powtarzalność misji. W każdej kampani misja 1 była taka sama, był taki sam cel (tylko z lekka zmieniona mapa i inne pojazdy) jak i reszta z nich. Taka powtarzalność powodowała, że po kilku godzinach grania gra stawała się nudna. Jednak wynagradzało to długość i rozmaitość opcji przejścia misji, dla przykładu: misję mogłem przejść tylko przy użyciu piechoty (różnych jednostek od zwykłych strzelców, po ludzi z bazookami) albo czołgów wraz z piechurami. Grafika nie jest najgorsza, ale i zarazem nie zwala z krzesła. Zadowoliło mnie również to, że twórcy dali puścić wodze wyobraźni modderów. W Steam Workshop jest wiele map i modyfikacji, które po przejściu gry, dadzą nam kolejnych kilka godzin zabawy. Niestety rzuca się w oczy brak języka polskiego (w moim przypadku na początku wszystko było dobrze, dopiero po jakimś czasie pojawiły się jakieś rosyjskie znaki, zamiast naszych, polskich co w połączeniu dawało polskie wyrazy, w których zamiast np: 'ł' był znak z bodajże cyrylicy).   Niestety gra to to samo co jego poprzedniczka z kilkoma nowościami (tyczy się to trybu singleplayer jak i multiplayer)  Podsumowanie: +grafika +długość misji +różne sposoby przejścia misji +wiele osiągnięć +fajna rozgrywka... -...która szybko się nudzi -powtarzalność misji w kampaniach (czyli jeden wielki żart ze strony twórców) -'język polski' -to nadal to samo  Grę polecam tylko fanom tego typu rozgrywek, inni, niezbyt przepadający za tego typu grami odradzam.",1,0

50620,Darksiders,"This game is amazing! It's like a mix of Devil May Cry, Legend of Zelda, Portal, and Fable The Lost Chapters and balanced nearly perfectly. Combat is fluid and fun and the insane amount of combos and moves makes itfresh and not repetitive (unless you make it repetitive by just spamming the mouse button :P) Power ups are cool and are utilized well IMO. There's a lot of action but also a lot of puzzles and many oppurtunities for exploration. It's an open world and many paths to other areas require puzzles and such and most of the puzzles don't feel tedious and are challenging but very intuitive. There are few exceptions (freeing Azrael took FOREVER and was kinda tedious). Boss fights were a highlight in this game. Bosses were tough but had patterns that you'll pick up on after a while. But using the patterns to your advantage takes skill and precise timing. There are collectibles that help you, like finding artifacts that you can trade in for currency, 10 pieces of armor you can find, chests that include either currency, wrath, health, health or wrath shards to increase your total capacities, trinkets that show you where chests and artifacts are in the area, keys, etc. Cool gadgets and gear offer more variety and also help in puzzles such as a grapple, the voidwalker which is essentially a Portal gun, the shadow mask to go back and forth between the shadow realm and your realm (no this isn't Yu-Gi-Oh in any way), etc. Plus you get to ride a horse that can even help in combat. Controls are great IMO, and I played on the keyboard. Left Alt for dash felt weird at first, but after finding a good placement of my hand on the keyboard it became easy and flowed well. It took me about five minutes or less to get used to. The using CAPS LOCK + 1, 2, or 3 for abilities was the only thing I thought was a bit tricky. I rarely felt the need to use them, though. Also underwater movement was fluid and fun, which is rare I think in a game. The story was really engaging. The ending also had a great little twist. Voice acting was great, save for a few parts, with Mark Hamill doing a full-on Joker voice for the Watcher and Liam O'Brien, the guy who voices Gaara in the english dubbed Naruto series sounding like an ancient version of Gaara as War, the main character. Yes, it's just as awesome as it sounds. The added ability to pick up items in the environment such as cars or telephone poles and use as weapons only added to all the chaotic fun. The boss death scenes were all brutal and soooooo satisfying. I highly recommend this game, it is amazing and the exploration and hidden places and objects adds to replayability.",1,0

Easy menu and easy controls when you understand them (as I'm using a keyboard and this game is totaly made for controllers but it's still playable without any problems) 3. Gameplay is fun.  Cons: 1. Puzzles sometimes offer an inunderstandable situation, like moving a statue that is located in some corner (and looks EXACTLY as a 'checkpoint'). 2. For people who take Lord of the Rings seriously (as I do) won't understand what's funny in the 'humor' that's in the game such as the intro: 9 people are holding their rings and one of the rings falls.

440420,True Fear: Forsaken Souls Part 1,"'may my mind stroll about hungry  and fearless and thirsty and supple  and even if it's sunday may i be wrong  for whenever men are right they are not young' (E.E. Cummings)   Sometimes, one great story can change everything. But with Goblinz, it isn't just the story (written by the team leader, Dimmie Azu), but also how the story is being told and shown. There is definitely something new and better in what they do. True Fear is an engaging and immersive experience, very different from what the developers of casual games have offered so far, making us feel surprisingly close to Holly, the main character, almost experiencing her fears and anxieties.   There are so many questions left unanswered in True Fear we could talk about this story for hours. Goblinz deliberately chose what not to show (because, as they have already explained, to give away too much information would spoil the impact of the revelations). Since they work like professional writers, strategically placing the bread crumbs for us to follow, I am sure that in the end everything will make sense. They show us just a hint of a tail knowing we will realize a cat awaits us. Goblinz are special because everything matters, because everything was carefully planned and beautifully executed.   I've played the first game and looked at the screenshots and cut scenes so many times that now and then I felt inside the house, trying to find out what had happened and trying to decide where to go. No other game had this effect on me. I wonder if I admire it so much because it feels like a movie – one that would make Hitchcock very proud of his influence! And it feels like a movie based on a great book/a best seller - so much that it makes us long for the full immersion of VR. I hope Steam will be interested in taking the next step, making the player experience the game as Holly (or other characters) using VR - and how could we refuse the opportunity to see the world through her eyes, even as dangerous and frightening as it may be? I just love the way the trailer of the sequel whispers: 'Let me take you to a time before Hell broke loose'...   I truly believe Goblinz has a bright future waiting to unfold and that Dimmie is a creative genius, as well as a fully committed professional. May he always feel “young”, “fearless and thirsty”.",1,0

Finally no more black borders or limited resolutions to contend with here. This is easily one of the most beautiful games of its type ever made.  The game plays very much like a sonic adventure, or perhaps even an interactive soundtrack. After solving certain puzzles, stunning music from Floex plays and sometimes the little space gnome does this cute little dance. Like most of Amanita's games, the overall effect is a hypnotic dreamlike quality that is very calming and utterly charming.  At around 8-10 hours of play time depending on how much you stop to admire the gorgeous visuals (or look up the included hint book), it's shorter than some of Amanita's other games. However when you consider the quality of the music in the deluxe edition with soundtrack in better-than-CD quality, it's well worth it.",1,0
261760,Lichdom: Battlemage,"Lichdom: Battlemage is one of those games that pulls you in with enticing screenshots and explosive trailers that showcase its frantic violence, but turns out to be a crushing disappointment and an empty promise of what could have been. Any potential is trampled by the mind-numbingly tedious gameplay, levels that drag on for far too long and the supposed crown jewel; an underwhelming and prosaic spell system. You will engage in fights that are challenging and enjoyable; however, these are few and far between, and as you progress further into the game you feel less and less powerful as enemy encounters take an increasingly absurd amount of time to grind through. The visuals are gorgeous, particularly those of the landscapes and spells, not surprising given the engine it was created with.  The search for playing as a truly unstoppable killing machine of a mage continues, as this does not provide it.  4/10",-1,0

As most of the reviews have said, this game is mostly smooth. Great Concept, But executed terribly.  The character models may look iffy and well, as most people said ugly, look past that and you see a decent game.   I also see some people talking about how this game is P2W (pay to win). But speaking from personal experience, it doesnt have to be. I know a bunch of top players who didnt pay a single cent.  Also did i mention how the developers are just lazy? There was a glitch i believe that happened during February 29th 2016, Where all the dragons were avalaible as the free rotation. You couldn't upgrade dragons you had or sell them during that time. Guess when did the developers found out about it and fixed it?  About a month later.  Yeah, this game is great, and i love it. But developers put some goddamm effort to it for god's sake.  But the true thing that makes this game terrible is the community.  Salty af brazilian/spanish/russian mofo spamming chat. Afk idiots. Rage quitters. People with horrible internet. Take you're pick.  But all in all, its an enjoyable experience as long as you look past its terrible spots. Should you try it? Well if you're bored, have a laggy computer that can't run Dota2 or Leauge of legends, then yeah sure why not. But don't have too high hopes tho.

I will spare the obvious bugs that will be fleshed out anyway, which amusingly enough should have been back in Beta. But will focus on why you should wait before buying it.  -Friends queue: as most point out, there is none. It works like this: 3 get in, 4th joins and leaves to find their soul mate. Match-making goes 'Room full? GL I'm otta here' and then all leave (Insert sad Hunter face here)  -Leveling system: the whole thing is around RND and as we all know, RND hates you or the person you play with. You either get lucky and level a shadow assassin or a Doctor with a masters degree. OR become a petty brown perk scavanger who can only put a tiny bandage over another ankle. The whole thing feels like a lottery for all pool of points with no way to upgrade things or re-roll them  -Ranking: mainly hunter! I love a bit of competition in any game I play, do well get a medal. Do bad you're put stark naked in front of the class. But good enough to progress ONLY when catching all 4 survivors makes it seem like no matter how fast, good or skillfully you catch 3, if you can't get 4th you best go play Mario my dear friend because you are not worthy!  -Last but not least: the f-ing generator scale. How many times did I blow it up JUST because the spot to hit space appears like 20% the way of it. Why is this ticking me off? Because that is how long it takes for the whole scale to appear solid from totally invisible. So by the time you see when you need to press space it's too late.  The whole release seems rushed, both testing and balance. It's playable, fun and the atmosphere is amazing. I get a rush playing survivors who can't defend themselves vs that beast of a hunter. While as a hunter punishing them all if I'm able to. However, it is not quite there so until the game feels -release- solid I'm giving thumbs down.",-1,0

Campaign map is much more better then Shogun 2 and Empire Total War and land battles are more realistic then other total war games (especially when you buy blood and gore dlc). Only problem is that multiplayer is little slow then single player ı hope they can fix this soon. As a result I can vouch for this game buy it and have fun with it:),1,0

The physics seems to work, nothing wrong with that.  The big problem is the big mess that is the menu and controls, isn't intuitive, has lots of bugs, and overall you start to get frustrated with the controls since is really hard to build what you want  If they could fix this the game could be great, but honestly, I'm not on the mood of explore it more",-1,0
234630,Project CARS,"I bought this game already owning Assetto Corsa, which I like very much. I was very skeptical and felt that the game was over hyped in the raceing sim community. I play on a dated laptop running with an old Nvidia 635m and use a gamepad. I was very surprised when I was acutally able to play this game at a decent frame rate (on very low settings), while on Assetto Corsa I can't get any reasonable frame rate. I was also very surprised to see that the factory gamepad setting were usable, I am constantly fiddleing with my settings on Assetto Corsa and they just never seem to be right. I am very pleased with the game for my setup.  As far as it being a sim goes the cars in general feel much easier to drive than Assetto Corsa. In PCars there have been several situation where I felt that I had more grip than I should (playing without any assists), but overall its very satisfying and never really gives me the feeling that I am cheating the laws of physics too much. A minor gripe I have is that some of the cars I found shared the same brake whine, it really bothered me when I was driving a super car and the brakes whined under minor load when a 40 year old cars brakes whined in the same situation ??? I really liked the selection of cars in this game, although I would LOVE to see more vintage F1 cars (Licenses I know).   Overall if you can, buy both PCars and AC, if you're poor like me just buy this.",1,0

323720,Decay - The Mare,"Decay: The Mare reminded me a lot of old point and click games; Myst and Riven come to mind. However, requiring a notebook for only one string of numbers, the game isn't nearly as deep or rooted in puzzle as Myst. It's basically a point and click adventure game that resembles that of an 'Escape the room' flash game. However, the little nuances and timely jump-scares kept me playing.   The story started to pick up a little over halfway through and although room navigation is sometimes difficult, the puzzles are simple yet require a little more thought than usual, keeping the pace fairly consistent throughout. There wasn't a point where I got stuck and wanted to quit.   The conclusion and resolution to the game makes you feel satisfied of the journey you took to get there.   All in all, not bad for a two and a half hour playthrough.",1,0

Out of nowhere a helicopter loaded with enemies was flying directly towards me and i decided it would be a good idea to shoot at drawing attention to myself.

519140,Minds Eyes,"I didn't hate this but I didn't love it either. It was interesting to me, though! It has some creepy moments - and if you like atmospheric horror with some jumpscares, it's worth at least a little of your time, especially as a freebie.  But I'm not writing this as a review for other players - I mean, it's free, you can't complain too much if you hate it. This is more directed at the dev 'cause I think there's a fair bit of potential here - and, after all, it is a game made to harvest reactions.  I'll be writing spoilers after here, if anyone wants to avoid them!  --  The atmosphere and tension within the first house portion was pretty decent. It set up some good world building, and things moving when the player wasn't looking set up for some creepy moments - I really like that, feeling as if, maybe if I'd looked over my shoulder quick enough, I might have been able to see the monster? I know logically that's not possible within the constraints of the game, but the feeling that it was near was exciting. I felt like you were trying to emulate P.T.? And that's a really good starting point for inspiration honestly.  The monster itself had its good moments - it making noises and lurking just out of sight was good, kept me on edge. The model for it was kind of weak up close, though - so seeing it in full light and up close just made me giggle a bit. And that bit where it peeked around the door was just comical. Even with a stronger model, though, it's a lot better if you don't see the monster up close near the start, if at all. Fear comes largely from unknown, and being confronted face to face with what you're dealing with may startle the player, but after the initial jump, it's a lot less frightening.  The computer bit was... awful, honestly. The lead-up to it was great! The long corridors reminded me of House of Leaves, and the boiler room was menacing. But the level design in the computer room was overcomplicated and frustrating. Too many rooms, not enough distinguishing features to help you remember where you're supposed to go. The fear level just plummets after that. Repeatedly seeing the monster, laughing at the monster's movements, and getting killed by the monster, only to be reset and have to attempt it again just weakens the game dramatically. It would have been a lot creepier if the monster was present, but not chasing you, I think. A lurking presence, one that you're aware of through sounds and shadows, is far creepier than one that confronts you head-on.  Then, back in the house, things get creepy again. The house was definitely the game's strongest point, although I suspect there was a lot of delayed timing, which got pretty frustrating after a while. Waiting without knowing whether or not you're actually supposed to just be waiting, or if you're supposed to actually be doing something, doesn't add anything.  I liked the end - I'm not a huge fan of coma stories generally, so having that as the big reveal didn't do much for me, but that's personal preference. Going abstract with the consciousness platformer, though? I dug that. Falling off the ledges was kinda frustrating though - maybe making that a bit easier to deal with would be an idea. Or even just having the character reset back to the start without the loading screen? It would feel more like a dreamstate that way, kind of disconcerting.  I think, to the dev, the technical things you need to look at are pacing and level design. Otherwise, you have a lot of good technical knowledge in place, it just needs fine-tuned.  You'd probably benefit from another writer on your next games, if you can find someone to collaborate with. Someone to read over the premise you have and add their own thoughts and feedback, to give it a bit more depth before you get to the stage of actually even making the game itself.  On a horror level, it would benefit you to sit and think what actually scares you. The parts that were actually scary preyed on the fears of the unknown; fear of the darkness; of unseen and malevolent forces; of things being out of place in your own home and not knowing why; of not knowing what you're supposed to do; of being trapped. The parts that weren't scary were big goofy monsters with chainsaws. But why did you put it in? Are you afraid of monsters? Or are you afraid of death? Are you afraid of pain? Are you afraid of something larger than you taking away your agency? Or did you just think other people would like it? I'm not giving you a right or wrong answer - you're the only one that knows what scares you. And you can't make a scary game just catering to what other people like - you have to know for yourself what you're afraid of and why you're afraid of it.  Play good horror games. Play bad horror games. Take notes on why things did and didn't scare you. Read and watch horror, too - taking inspiration from other mediums is vital to keep fresh. And play similar games from other genres, too, that have similar mechanics. If you haven't already, check out some popular walking exploration games and take notes on what makes them fun. I'd recommend taking notes from The Stanley Parable; Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald; Gone Home; Dear Esther; The Path. You've probably already played Slender. Especially with Stanley Parable and Dear Esther, try get your hands on the original versions as well as the final releases - they're free online as they're mods of HL2 - and compare them with the final releases to see what they changed and what they kept or refined.  And I wouldn't spam any of your future games with elements just because you feel like they're good gimmicks, either. Like, the teddy thing? Did nothing for me. Collectibles are cool in some games but the way it was presented just didn't work, and if you're focusing on a story like this one you're less likely to be looking for stuff to collect, especially if it holds no value to the gameplay. If you want to keep it, maybe making things a bit more subtle would save it.  Also, aesthetically, I liked your house design a lot. It wasn't just bare, there were enough decorations to make it feel lived-in. I would advise if you're making another house level in future games to actually add more of that - the more it feels like a place someone actually stays in the creepier it is to have a monster moving around in it. It's a juxtaposition that's really unsettling, I think! The boiler room, too - very nicely done. The steam was atmospheric as heck, and the whole lead-up to it with the wallpapered rooms was creepy, and kind of a jolt in change of scenery. It felt surreal, and I liked that.  Overall, you have talent here - don't get discouraged by negativity in reviews, please, because as a feedback-gaining exercise, this has been a huge success for you! I look forward to trying out any future games you come out with, and I hope you can take the things you've learned from this and implement them even better! Plus, disregard people getting mad about it - people who don't make games don't understand just how much time and effort it takes even to make simple things. While the game isn't perfect, it shows that you've dedicated a lot to making it. I don't know if this is a profession or a hobby for you, but it doesn't really matter - if you enjoy it, keep on going and make things that you love :) I hope this was helpful - sorry it turned into a bit of a wall of text! Good luck, and thank you for the game!",1,0

Compelling characters, kickass music with a handful of sweet leitmotifs, unique and non-tedious combat system, satisfying storyline.  It's sort of like OFF, but not tedious and long-winded. Like, I knew I wanted to keep going 20 seconds into the title screen here but couldn't stomach more than an hour of OFF.  Good replay value. Secrets. Good psychological mind-games with the player. Totally picks the brain of a speedrunner-type person if you go through killing everything and one of the enemies adapts his combat-style in order to get to YOU instead of just killing the character.  Good at making the whole 'save point' thing actually part of the canon of the game. Introduces a boring/♥♥♥♥♥♥ looking character right off the bat and makes him actually interesting.  10/10. Like, 9.something repeating. Very, very small elements of tediousness that go away fast. Maybe necessary for the feeling of the game idk it was well-paced and I don't regret it.

This game, although the worst of all the Trine series, is not a complete waste of time. Yes they have taken out leveling up and gaining powers. Yes you can't build towers of boxes with the mage or form a box, then jump off it in the air. Yes controlling boxes and items and moving them in 3d and trying to manipulate what youre standing on with the box is terrible. Yes the archers arrows can be funky, sometimes not letting you tie things together, sometimes breaking in the middle of pulling the item. Yes the selecting of multiple targets witht he wizard and archery is finnicky and very cluncky and imprecise. Yes the combat is bad and is just hammering attack button. Yes being in 3d means you can't tell where youre jumping or you'll land, leading to many deaths. Yes grabbing on to ledges sometimes doesn't work and isn't precise. Yes the game is short, and ends abruptly for no reason right in the middle of the story with no conclusion because the studio ran out of money.   BUT navigating around the levels in 3D can sometimes be fun. The levels are big, long, absolutely beautiful. They are varied. Some of the platforming can be fun when its not frustrating. The physics are excellent. There is the same cheeky sense of humor. All in all they should have probably stuck to 2d because of how much worse all the characters and their powers are, and how finnicky many of the systems are. But its still an ok game. Definitely not worth full price.   7/10.",1,0

35140,Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition,"Everyone has watched Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. After these very different Batman Movies, this game was released and it steps back and trys something different.  The Lock and Feel is more like/similar to an old Comic than an more realistic Nolan Batman.  I watched no trailer, i didn't read a review at all. I just bought the game and was stuned !  Even the Hunt for the Collectables and the Achievements was exciting. And - by the way - the PC Version is the best.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Jeder hat schonmal Batman Begins oder The Dark Knight gesehen. Nach diesen Filmen kam nun Arkahm Asylum, welches einen Schritt zurücktritt und etwas völlig anderes versucht.  Der Still des Spiels ist eher mit dem von Comics zu vergleichen und das passt.  Und die PC Version sieht fantastisch aus.  =================================================================  Result: Must have Title - 9/10",1,0

There's a lot that you can get out of this realtime roguelike, and the randomness of everything is fun to play around with. If you're going to play it for a long while, you'll probably notice lines or events that repeat, but it's still an excellent game. The amount of modding that's available (despite designed not for modding) will give you plenty of replayability. Get it now, or get it whenever. Just play it.",1,0

466170,Idling to Rule the Gods,"This game was my life. I used to play this game all the time when it was on Kongregate. This is definitely the sort of game where you need to be patient to be able to do anything at all, but if you put the time into it, new things will unlock, and you will be able to create matter, build monuments, trade things and even convert those matter into planets and the such. And now I can see that there are new features added into the mix; I am really looking forward to playing with that. Overall,Idling to Rule the Gods is definitely something you should leave in the background whilst you do other things, and come back to see how the avatar 'you' did whilst you were elsewhere. I definitely recommend a try at the very least, maybe you can grow to like the charms of this strange little idle game.  EDIT: And now I found out that there are lores, detailed lores that outlines how you've came to be, why you are fighting creatures and gods, as well as how your powers came to be, and how they relates to gods. This is amazing and it tied the different pieces of game mechanics together. I have never expected such a detailed lore for this game, and now I am more glad than ever to have found this game again years after the last time I played it.",1,1

274480,Drox Operative,"If you were a fan of Armada on the Dreamcast, if you like Action RPG's with random loot drops, if you like space sim type games with options for diplomacy between races or choices to sabotage, spread rumors, etc, then I would highly recommend Drox Operative!  This game reminds me a lot of Armada, which was one of the greatest games on the Sega Dreamcast in my opinion. And as of right now this is the closest game we have to a true Armada style game on PC.   One small complaint I do have with Drox Operative however is the lack of visual ship customization. You basically choose a race at the beginning and are given a default ship and then you have to increase your Command skill to change the look of your ship and it also adds more slots to equip gear. What I would like to see is the ability to buy different styles of ships or the ability to customize the appearance of the ships. That being said, it is a small complaint but should not deter anyone from picking up this great game.  I would give Drox Operative an 8 -8.5/10, Pick it up, you will not be disappointed.",1,0

218620,PAYDAY 2,"The game consists of a variety of 'heists' that a player can opt to either carry out by themselves, with the AI, or as part of a multiplayer game. There are heists such as bank robberies, drug trafficking runs, rigging an election, or stealing smuggled nuclear warheads. Some of the heists put a large emphasis on stealth, often leading to bonus experience points and money on completion.  The level selection menu is styled as a fictional website,  Crime.net , where missions pop up periodically as contracts in a map of Washington D.C.[6][7] The player can pick up an open contract, join a contract another player has started, or buy a contract with in-game money in an offshore bank account. There are five difficulty levels, with increased money and experience payouts for higher difficulty levels. Independent of difficulty is the 'pro job' condition - pro jobs give additional experience, but cannot be retried if the players fail. Some contracts in Payday 2 take place over multiple days, with each day represented by a separate level with different objectives.[8] After a day is complete the game may add an escape level, where the players' original escape is thwarted and they must survive to reach their backup getaway.[7]  Many jobs in Payday 2 can be completed in stealth. If players avoid getting caught on camera, evade or silently kill security guards, and keep any civilian witnesses from calling the police, the alarm will not be raised and the players will receive an experience bonus. Otherwise, players will have to achieve their objectives, carry out any loot they find to a dropoff point, and then reach their escape point under the pressure of constant police assault waves. Most of the enemies are SWAT units sourced from DC Police, then FBI SWAT and finally GenSec private security contractors as difficulty increases. Mixed in with these are special units; all versions of Payday 2 include the 'Shield' and the 'Taser' - both named for their signature equipment, the 'Bulldozer' - a SWAT team member in a modified near-bulletproof bomb suit, and snipers. The Crimewave Edition and PC port include the 'Cloaker' - an infiltration and hand-to-hand combat expert. Exclusive to the PC version are robust SWAT van turrets, capable of area denial, and Captain Winters, a well-protected veteran police officer who sustains assaults and buffs enemies until he can be driven off.  If a player takes too much damage they will be knocked down and incapacitated. If no one helps them back up, or if they are downed a number of times without healing, they will be taken into custody. On lower difficulty levels players in custody will eventually respawn, but otherwise their teammates must take a hostage to trade to get them back into the game. A job is failed if all players are downed or in custody.  At the end of each heist, the player is presented with a screen with three cards, one of which is to be chosen by the player (called a 'Payday'). These bonus cards can be either weapon modifications, masks, colors or materials for masks, or experience or money boosters. Players can purchase and customize masks, although these are purely cosmetic and have no effect on the gameplay.",1,0

12200,Bully: Scholarship Edition,"Definitely one of Rockstar's more focused efforts in their long line of open games, Bully still succeeds in staying true to the formula with a somewhat, just a bit though, focused narrative and time constraints imposed on the player by the very nature of the game - attending school. Characters and story are memorable and clearly intended as exaggeration of high-school stereotypes, although many come as 1-shots for some reason. One can't help but praise out-of-nowhere dramatic final confrontation which ends up being EXTREMELY satisfying and just, though. Only really negative side I can think of is the fact that this isn't such a great port.",1,0

410850,DRAGON QUEST HEROES™ Slime Edition,"The gameplay is engaging and the framerate is rock solid. You can switch between 30 or 60, suiting your preference. Finally, a dual audio release; and it's dragon quest. So you know what you're getting yourself into.  Only major point of contention is that there's an odd bug in the game with Nvidia GPU &amp; drivers, where depending on location of a mass of enemies coupled with a special attack, leads to some kind of a collision detection bug which causes the driver itself to crash and the game along with it. So far, has only happend prior to non-lengthy cutscenes. People with AMD GPUs on the other hand are likely freed from this issue, due to the PS4 being an AMD GCN core.  The voice work is excellent and overall, is a very engaging and charming JRPG. I haven't progressed more than an hour into the game, but so far I would recommend it. If you have an Nvidia GPU wait until the next driver release and/or until the game fits your discretionary budget for purchase. But, definitely get it.",1,0

401680,POSTAL Redux,"After waiting for this game to come out since the moment it was announced, I'd say that my opinions about POSTAL Redux are a bit mixed. I like this game, but I wanted to love it. Here are the pros and cons.  Pros: *Better gameplay than the original, it plays like an actual 3/4 isometric shooter, no-more tank controls.  *Rampage mode is awesome, especially that alternate ending!  *The new remastered OST is amazing, I just wish that all of them were remastered and not just most. Also amazing are the tracks for Rampage mode  *The levels are even more gorgeous than the originals, and I like how animated they are with car lights flicking on and off and flies around garbage, among other things.  *The new revolver and carnival levels are awesome, I love shooting clowns!  Cons: *Biggest one, the new ending. I understand why RWS changed the original ending, but what they replaced it with is just boring. The original ending sequence with the school kids was shocking and gut wrenching, it left me shivering by the time the credits rolled. Here, the ending is just...I don't get it. Why is he at a grave? Why is he fainting? The original ending had an obvious meaning showing the depths of the P. Dude's madness, here I have no clue what's going on. And as much as RWS may deny it, they certainly did change it because of outside influence, Vince Desi even says as much in their recent Playboy interrview.   * The new cutscene art is a mixed bag. While they're certainly faithful recreations, I feel they're too smooth, too digital. Maybe this is due to tech limits of computer screens in '97, but the original artworks had texture to them, they all looked gritty and acidic, like you'd burn your hand if you reached out and touched them. In Redux, some of the art is amazing, like the Construction Site and Trailer Park, but others like the Parade and the Mine look cartoonish, almost like they're from a children's story book. I wish RWS had gotten Randy Briley, the original artist from '97, to do remakes of his old work.  * Weapons need for umph to them, right now they're rather unexciting to use. They need to sound louder, deadlier, they ought to push the player back, have recoil, feel like actual guns. Also, they oughta be balanced more in terms of when the player gets them. Halfway through the game the player already has most weapons.    I suppose that's it, besides some misc. glitches which I'm sure RWS will fix through patches. Like I said, mixed feelings, but I'd go so far as to say that if you love the POSTAL series and wanna support RWS and don't mind the cons listed above, go ahead and buy it.",1,1

9880,Champions Online,"A superhero MMO best experienced with friends.  Even in the free-to-play portion (also known as Silver members), the costume system has the greatest degree of customization that I've ever seen in an MMO (and you can unlock a number of pieces through certain events - let me state that content the F2P crowd can unlock is a GREAT idea that every MMO should have). The game's item shop (the C-store) has a little bonus content, but most of the shop items are quality-of-life benefits.  That being said, the archetype system is a little confining (and allegedly more thematic than functional, according to at least a few Gold members I've talked to) and the true freeform development is only available to those who pay a monthly fee (the Gold members).  I'd say plunk down a few bucks for a hideout and more inventory space and don't worry about any monthly subscription unless you're planning on this being the only game you play.  Even then, be aware that Cryptic is unlikely to fix any further bugs with this game, even the ones that have been around for several years. I'd argue this one is dying.",1,0

The game can be too complex because of the small environment with limited ammunition, health, armor and depending on the difficulty level being set will make you frustrated &amp; bored or just bored.  My advice is to just play the black edition and overdose, everything else labeled painkiller seems like a dissapointment.",-1,0

241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,One of the few games that has actually lived up to its hype. I don't know about the season pass but the price tag on the base game is actually fair. Not even a bit overpriced in my opinion. The game does have its faults but they're so minor that you generally won't notice them or just let them go because you're having fun. I'd definitely give this game a 10 out of 10. It misses the 11 by just a few years.,1,0

222730,Reus,"Reus is strategy build up game where the player controls 4 giants that can set up the ground and resources to start a village. You try to maintain the village progress by building projects. The villages can collect science points, food points, and money points. The four giants will help you choose and shape up the resources for each village, while completing a project will grant you more resources and ambassador that will upgraded the giant ability and their fore, the giant ability to improve the resources of the village.  With those rules, you are limited in the amount of time, where after that, the giants sleep and you see your results and total points number (total= prosperity)   Depending on the results, you progress in the game.  The game is very addictive and has a beautiful art style and beautiful layout. The game will suit any fan of strategy and building managements. I spent many hours and I still can find enjoyments in it.   I recommend this game.  ",1,0

24980,Mass Effect 2 (2010),"This is by far the best game I have ever played and I say that without hyperbole I love this game to death. I've put In over 150 hours into a 12-13 hour game I think the €15 I payed was very very much worth it. If you have never played a mass effect game you need to, there is something about this game and characters that make me actually care about what happens to every one of them giving my decision much more weight.It a bioware game the story Is always good so they don't get points for that anymore but the main focus of this game was the combat which greatly make the game more fun and I felt didn't take away from any role playing elements as some people would claim.Keeping this in mind certian parts of the games combat can feel over whelming at times giving you incentive to turn off auto cast on your compainions abilities and use them manually giving you the ability to focus fire or divert fire away from someone or you.  This game doesn't have the best sound track (That goes to Transistor) however It is certainly one of the best out there with some songs sending chills down my spine, making me on edge and creeped out or making me want to murder every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ In the room In the most badass way possible.  Mass effect ones guns felt a bit light and weak however In mass effect 2 they actually feel like something that might cause damage the a small bug and not like someone sneezing In a large room (We're all looking at you one gun from the doom 3 trailer) However It would be nice If the gun sounds varied a bit more because you might get sick of them and use your biotics instead.",1,0
335240,Transformice,Community is immature and toxic. It doesn't help that the game is geared towards 12 year olds and a moderator is as rare as a unicorn.  The gameplay is less than average. The majority of the time you're dependant upon another player to lay down the path for you to follow. And it doesn't help if that player is new or a troll. The whole thing is a grind.  The only redeeming quality of Transformice is the ability to build your own maps.   Things that would improve this game: - Faster leveling. - Make the game less dependant upon the shaman. - Allow all players to add something to the paths.  - Shaman tutorial.,-1,0

The story seems a little weak at first for who haven't read the books because it relies on you caring about Ciri as much as Geralt does for a majority of the game. It's highly recommended you read some of them and play the previous games, but the game still does have some parts where Geralt will talk about some of his memories to help new players understand his motives better.",1,0

Yes there are ofcourse cons like getting used to controls and camera but if you want to say bad about this game about its bad mechanics, go try playing darksouls2 on pc without a controller &gt;.&lt; if you can live through the start of getting around then it really is a enjoying game.

9050,DOOM 3,"Returning to DOOM 3 after twelve (!) years of other first person shooters is simultaneously refreshing and frustrating.  Pacing is generally fantastic, and the game is still oh so atmospheric. Audio logs are fantastically voiced, the environmental storytelling is great, generally speaking it does a fantastic job at creating the impression of a real working facility full of scared and frustrated workers. The dark industrial sci-fi theme is well realised and consistent, everything fits together nicely and the demon designs are my favourite of the series. Though I will admit they look more alienish than demonic, I still think they fit well for this particular game.  DOOM 3 is from a time before mission markers, so if you're not careful you can easily get lost. I found I adjusted fairly quickly to this, and became better at overcoming obstacles without guidance after a few hours. It can be frustrating, but the lack of any assistance does enhance the feeling of isolation and claustraphobia, and gives the game a nice survival horror esq aftertaste. Exploration feels more natural because of the lack of hand-holding, in my opinion. It's not nearly as bad as DOOM II, which had me searching for hours on some levels for that last bloody switch.  Some of DOOM 3 hasn't aged well, though, in my opinion. There's a distinct lack of agility in the player character, you'll rarely be able to dodge enemy attacks up close even by dashing backwards or to the sides. This can leave combat feeling like attrition, more a numbers game than a test of skill. Especially when you factor in DOOM 3's love of monster closets and spawning enemies behind you. The oppressive darkness doesn't help, it's literally pitch black in places which makes picking out targets an utter ballache. You can switch to the flashlight, but most of the time you'll be shooting one enemy whilst another approaches in total darkness from his flank.  Overall, though, I think DOOM 3 still does more right than wrong. It feels a little conflicted at times, like it's unsure whether it wants to be a horror game or an action game, but I think it does both well enough to be consistently enteraining.   It's like a time capsule, the embodiment of design sentiments from a time before Halo and Call of Duty really changed the scene.",1,0

It looks alive in its own way since they have not too neat coloring. And that makes the art more vibrant and beautiful!!!   Nice music. Even if there are just a few used soundtracks, but they fit in very well, and the game does not seem to need more then they have.  Enjoyable characters, I have played the almost all the routes, and its difficult for me too choose just one favorite xD.  Easy to get the best ending, though..  The negative thing is that the writting is not the best quality.. using the wrong names for some characters ( not that often though. ) And it does have a very simple language, repetitive of words in sort time. Or one's name gets replaced by squares. :S. There is also those small dots here and there in the middle of the words..  STILL! It conveys feelings! And that makes one still reading it till the end of the route, since it does take you in!   Also there is no voiceacting, and I do not see that as something negative, its nice anyway!

47810,Dragon Age: Origins - Ultimate Edition,"As a fan of Bioware RPGs in general, I've certainly enjoyed this one well enough. That said, in a post-Oblivion/Skyrim, post-Mass Effect world I'd have to call it somewhat lackluster - read on for specifics. Be that is it may, it's still a perfectly good experience for the vast majority of genre fans.  First off, let me address the namesake of Origins: the character origin stories. Each playthrough begins in one of several settings depending on your race and class. If a mage, you'll start in the regional magic academy. If you're a dwarf, either in the wealthy district of your hold (if a noble) or its slums (if an outcast); an elf, likewise, can start in the slums of a human city or among a woodland tribe. The human origins are along the same lines. This initially seems like a great idea, but other than the demographics behind each prologue (race and social class) it has very little effect on the remaining 95% of the game, making it more of a gimmick. If someone were to use it in a more open-world, Bethesda-style game, I think it would work much better, but the post-prologue chapters in Origins are too on-the-rails for much impact.  Dragon Age's setting, apparently adored by many, I generally found to be disappointingly generic, whether in its tiny set of run-of-the-mill fantasy races, pseudo-European aesthetic, or blandly humanoid Darkspawn. With just a few known civilizations and a scant handful of other groups, the geopolitical outlook is on the thin side as well, especially if you're used to Middle-Earth or Tamriel. On the other hand, the Grey Warden narrative is pretty fun, there is some dynamic intrigue among the existing groups, and the monotheistic main religion is unexpected in its parallels to real-world belief systems. The subjugation of elves by humans is another surprising twist, putting a different spin on our expectations and providing a vehicle for some social commentary.  Combat, as in Knights of the Old Republic, involves giving commands while the characters do the actual fighting, which is pausable at any point for orders and inventory-diving. This is great if you play a mage or stealth-based rogue, but with a fighter or archery-focused rogue it gets somewhat tedious. Those, by the way, are the only three classes to choose from, though each has a reasonably wide range of options and tweaks within its bounds.  Bioware is consistently good at creating interesting companion characters with equally interesting party dynamics, and this entry is no exception. You accumulate a virtual platoon of cronies ranging from femmes fatales to an intelligent war hound, all given life by top-notch voice acting. Relationships can be built or eroded both by words and actions, and a personalized gift-giving mechanic is included in case you don't want to lose the help of that pesky evil witch/goody-two-shoes. Romances are likewise on the table, including options for a gay character, and so are love triangles and jealous spats.  The storyline, like most of the setting, is more than a little generic - you are the fated hero who must save the world from the evil overlord and his implausibly monstrous minions - but it's enough to keep you involved. Travel between areas is fairly free, but their relative difficulty levels were not created equal, so don't forget to save before you venture forth.  Overall, not a bad game, and likely to appeal to many fans of the genre.",1,0

220240,Far Cry® 3,"A near-infinite maze of beautiful terrain, ancient ruins, diverse wildlife, and a drug cartel that is just as dangerous as the jungle itself. All of this is Far Cry 3, and more. As the game's somewhat repetitive marketing implies, protagonist Jason Brody entered the heart of insanity when he became stranded on Rook Island. The by-the-numbers plot is just interesting enough to pay attention to, and the twists and turns are predictable. With all of the writing having gone so badly, you'd imagine that the plot-related elements aren't worth watching. You'd be wrong. While the story is certainly not Far Cry 3's strong point, its characters are some of the most 'human' I've personally seen in a videogame yet. Vaas, the drug smuggler whose mind has gone to hell (and whom you have several run-ins with, none of them peaceful), is an extremely relatable character as he speaks to you, his view of the world one that is understandable, even acceptable, if he weren't a murderer. Huntley, the 'secret agent man', complete with military expertise and knowledge, as well as a seemingly-bottomless bag of jokes aimed at Soviet Russia. There are too many memorable characters to name, and the only way to really experience them all is to give this game a play.  For me, personally, exploration is the heart of Far Cry 3. The ability to go anywhere, and do whatever you want with the island is a feature that, by itself, will chew up hours of playtime. The island has many things awaiting the curious traveler, including collectible statues, ancient ruins, radio towers (which will grant rewards upon activation), and enemy bases loaded to the brim with loot of many sorts. Exploration also rewards the player with easier fast-traveling, as cleared-out bandit safehouses become yours to use, complete with weapon shops and vehicles to commandeer. In addition, these same 'outposts' are also fast-ravel locations, allowing you to hop around to the map to that one mission that's too far away for you to walk (or even drive) to.  I could go into the hunting, and the crafting, and even the customization. But by the time I was done, I'd have told you all there is to know about it, and that'd spoil the magic. The hype is real, so I'd highly recommend picking up Far Cry 3. And if you do:  Welcome to the jungle. Enjoy your stay.",1,0

247730,Nether,"I really wish I can say this game is good, and to be honest, it was. It's one of those games where, it could be so much more if not for the rushing the devs had made. I actually paid for the chosen bundle as a preorder, because of the atmosphere, and the new approach of an enemy, rather than a simple zombie game. You get these, mutated human beings which can actually teleport right around you, which is actually pretty stressful if you have no idea how the A.I. Works. The envrioemnt is my style of a wasteland, you got chicago 'My hometown, in which I still live in' with a whole bunch of overgrowth, nature has claimed the city. And it's also got realy tall bulding, up to 6 or more floors high, which is actually pretty cool, considering it is an alpha game. The weapons are pretty limited, a pistol, a deagle, a sniper rifle, a auto rifle, a smg, a ar, you get the idea. All of this stuff was in the first release, and i must say, at the time, it was amazing despite a few glitches here and there. However, when the game sneaked out of early access 'Litterally just out of no where, POOF, game is done.' It really feel behind on what it was meant to deliver. But this isn't even the worse part. A friend of mine, namned -T- on my friends list was actually BANNED, for not only killing a hacker, but when he picked up his loot, which was normal except the money, 'He gained like, over 9 billion ingame $' he was then banned for the following reason 'It's impossible to kill a hacker, without you yourself using artificial means, aka something like hacks.' Which honestly blew my mind! I dont know what happend to you devs, but thats just messed up, you coulda just gave everyone a wipe, or even himself not only a inventory wipe, but a cash wipe. What would be so hard to do that for one individual?   In the end, something had happend, perhaps bankruptcy, and the game was ultimately rushed. Is the game worth 10$? Honestly, its up to you. But I presonally feel that the game just isnt worth it right now.",-1,1

244870,Electronic Super Joy,"ESJ is an extremely overhyped and over-rated platformer that boasts it's difficulty, art-style and music. While the music is quite nice, the art-style is extremely cluttered and many visual effects are extremely unpolished. The gameplay itself is described as 'The Unholy merging of Super Meat Boy &amp; Super Hexagon!' and unholy it is. If anything it combines bad aspects of the two games, the ridiculous lack of vision in some areas is reminiscent of the very progressed sections of Super Hexagon and the only similarity it has with Super Meat Boy is a lack of punishment for death(a good feature, don't get me wrong) and the fact that it's a difficult platformer.  There was nothing that compelled me to continue playing this game past the level shown in the 5th screenshot on the Steam Page [  http://i.imgur.com/4lkvh1q.jpg  ].  I would not recommend this game for it's regular price, for $2 maybe.  But ahead of games like I Wanna Be The Guy and Super Meat Boy? Hell no.",-1,0

228400,ACE COMBAT™ ASSAULT HORIZON Enhanced Edition,"Ace combat moves onto the next generation gaming, shame that its trying to copy the call of duty franchaise. The originals are what we want, but in this version you get allies that more or less there to fill space so theres a reason to hear radio chatter but otherwise you are out there on your own.  You are the ace of the fighter squadron but in this case you are constantly tring to out run missile after missile lock ons so much so at many points in the game you will find that you are chased by more then 5 or so fighters. Each fighter is just queuing to shoot you down and when you lose one, the next will take its place while the one you lost will find itself at the back of the queue.  Not only that but you get the new and exciting chase camera where granted it is very exciting as it is mostly auto pilot flying and you are just focusing on aiming and shooting the target down. On occation you will shoot your target down and find that the auto pilot lets go plummeting you towards the ground without any chance of recovery or slams you into a building as the moment you take out the enemy fighter, it was trying to evade you between buildings.  On top of this they will pull off impossible flips and end up behind you just as you fire missiles point blank after filling your aiming recticle to max in a increased chance of hit rate. This game is very exciting in the flight and fight action, shame that all the bits don't work out and no wonder this game is full of check points.  Tried multiplayer with a friend, in the end we believe that the game sadly does not scale for the actual number of players but is set to max whatever that is. We were constantly tailed by 5 fighters each all throughout the mission, ran out of missiles even if 70% of them all hit and ran out of time for the mission even though we were killing them decently if slowly.  Simple terms this game is very exciting if you like cheating npcs that constantly gang up on you and you only get 10 seconds to shoot someone in the calmer moments before being chased again. And again this isn't the ace combat games that we know of and the rumours that this is a bad game is sadly true.",-1,0

The music, characters, and bullet hell turn based combat system are amazing and I would easily play this game for those reasons alone. But what really makes this game shine is its story, and how the game changes according to how you play it.  There are two major paths, Pacifist or Genocide. They feel COMPLETELEY different, changing events and the world drastically. The game truly makes you feel the path you are taking. Doing a Genocide run after the Pacifist path is a trip, and may not be for the faint of heart.  Note that the game knows what you did, even if you load a previous save.  I loved playing this game, and I would highly recommend it. Definitely go for the extreme endings to get a true feel for it.

225080,Brothers - A Tale of Two Sons,"Charming short game that hits you with clever mechanics and unexpected feels.  I don't recommend playing with a keyboard at all. The game DOES support it despite it stating otherwise on it's store page, but you'll need a high key rollover for it to work at all, and the gamepad experience is really for the best given the games mechanic of controlling both characters at once.  Each of the two brothers you both control are assigned a thumb stick and a trigger each. You then work with them together to get around and progress through the world and solve puzzles that impede your progress. The puzzles in this game are fairly simple, and most players will never feel stuck at any point.  The world is filled with a colorful art style that really works well with the fantasy-esque universe and ranged from bright and happy to dark and spooky, looking good every step of the way. It runs on UE3 (Unreal Engine 3) and for me ran perfectly smooth as I'd expected from a UE3 title.  PC port doesn't have any video options other than resolution and vsync, so keep that in mind if you're playing on a low end machine.",1,0

104900,ORION: Prelude,"Even though it's been well over a year since I bought this and even though I only paid less than it's $10 asking price when it was called Dino Beatdown, I still regret buying this game. When I first heard they were going to re-release it, I didn't care. The only reason I decided to reinstall it was to get the Steam trading cards. I have no shame.  Playing it again (yes, I actually played it instead of idling in the menu), I noticed right away that it was way less buggy than and MUCH better optimized, not to mention all of the new content that was added. However, all the problems I had with the first game that weren't glitches were still present when I played it last.  I'm not sure if they're still there upon writing this, but I honesly don't care since the damage has already been done for me. The weapons lack punch, the animation is a joke, the maps are needlessly big, enemies are brain-dead, can go from pathetically easy to unfairly difficult at a moment's notice even with other players, and is just not fun.   Also, WHY is there a microtransaction store? This is not a free-to-play game.  Despite saying all of that, I will give the developers credit for greatly improving the game over what we first got, but...you already know the saying about polishing a turd.  4/10",-1,0
47790,Medal of Honor(TM) Single Player,"Single Player: Game starts off really strong with you thrown into the middle of a conflict following your squad through a war ravaged middle eastern town. The more you work with them though the more it's apparent that they will constantly hold back, waiting for you - the only badass who can storm a freaking target and use cover effectively to avoid fire - to clear the way before they move up.  Would be awesome if the game relied less on the constant leap-frogging dynamic of 'move up' .. 'wait' .. 'move up' .. 'wait' .. but if you can get past this, it's a pretty well done linear shooter.

There is a sandbox, but it just removes the space race objective and lets you run the space program as you want.  I only played on 'normal' which may as well be beginner-mode, and have not played the GSA faction, though from what I've seen it allows you to run soviet and US programs at the same time.  I'm told there will be expansions in the future such as building a space station and possibly a mars landing, but for the time being the game experience I had does NOT justify a $30 price, let alone a $20 price that I bought the game for.

Despite being a more story-driven game, DTM still bosts some replayability for all of its little secrets. Just reading the achievment list left me scratching my head: at no point was I ever aware that there was a even Ghost Pirate Ship with some kind of boss on it to fight. The combat is solid and enjoyable, the parrying is competent and functional for sure, and the ever changing environments and enemies keep the experience fresh.  This has to be the most honest B-Movie parody I've seen though. They just keeping pulling out more and more random monsters that will just be in the game for a few minutes and never again, and it's clearly intentional, and enjoyable, just waiting to see what is going to top the fight with a large dog wearing a vacuum cleaner and christmas lights. The director commentary was honestly fun; I thought it was just something they did for the trailer, and didn't realize it was like the premise of the entire game: the way it tells both the game's story, and the story of the movie's production is really neat and creative, and at no point does the game become 'just a game', it really stays consistent from start to finish.",1,0

211820,Starbound,"I'll start off by saying that Starbound isn't a terrible game. It certainly has some positive qualities. It looks fairly nice; it's a very colorful game with some very well-designed sprites. The mechanics are pretty solid, it feels good to play the game for the most part. It also has the potential to provide hours upon hours of entertainment.  But, despite some of these positive aspects to the game, there are huge problems with the game, and with the developer. I'll list some of these below.  1. The first of these issues is that Starbound has been released as 1.0. This is a problem because Starbound is not a complete game, there are still changes to the game's features that the developers plan to make in the future, and in fact, some features have been removed from the game so that the 1.0 release wouldn't be delayed, with uncertain statements by the devs that they  may  consider re-adding them in the future, post-1.0.  This is unacceptable in my opinion, because they're marketing this game as complete, and yet they may still end up making huge modifications that some players will be unhappy with, players who spent money on what they assumed was a final product.  2. As I mentioned above, Chucklefish have removed content from their game, and this has happened on multiple occasions. I would not normally condemn a developer for something like this, but much of the stuff they've removed have been things they've shown off in multiple dev blogs, content they've spent many hours working on, content that had no realistic reason to be removed. Dozens of racial weapons, racial SAIL AI, local chat, a number of vanity item sets, and much more. No reason has been given for this removal of content, content that was interesting and, in many people's opinions, contributed to a game that was originally very complex in design.  This further leads me to believe that this game is an unfinished product, and one that I fear may be subject to additional content removal in the future.  3. The third issue I have with Starbound is not so much directed at the game as it is directed at the developers, but it's an issue that affects all consumers of their product; Chucklefish's unreliability. Throughout the development of Starbound, its five year development of which half was early access, Chucklefish have made promises that they've failed to deliver on and yet have made no attempts to apologize for or acknowledge. Several release dates have been given in the past over the course of these five years, and Chucklefish failed to meet all of them. On several occasions, Chucklefish promised there would be no more universe or player wipes, and yet time and time again they forcibly wiped universe and player files thanks to seemingly arbitrary changes to file structure which have never been explained.  These would not be such concerning issues if Chucklefish had actually taken the time to explain to their players why these things were happening. Not once did we receive a blog post explaining why a release date had been missed, or why another universe/player wipe was forced.  4. And then the storyline. Admittedly, this is more of a personal feeling of disappointment than a glaring, objective issue, but the storyline is so incredibly generic. It follows the most basic formula possible; I'll do my best not to spoil anything, but you, the main character and thus the center of the universe, are one of the few survivors of a catastophe. You escape on your own and have to find your way to the hub world, where you meet the plot device meant to drive the story further. You're buried in exposition and sent off on your quest to defeat the ultimate evil, which had been sealed away ages ago and is finally breaking free. Eventually you face off against it after working with a crew of unique individuals and destroy the evil once and for all.  There was once a pretty interesting concept behind Starbound; you were a nobody trying to survive on your own after escaping certain doom, making do with what you could forage and build from the wild. They ended up trashing that idea and focusing time and effort on a boring story mission when their efforts should have been focused on the sandbox elements for their sandbox game.  I could likely rant on about this, but I've rambled long enough. Starbound isn't a terrible game, but because of the issues it's had in development, I cannot in my right mind rate it positively. It wouldn't be fair to the people who are expecting to buy a complete title. As far as I'm concerned, until Chucklefish is satisfied with Starbound's features and has no intentions to change them further, it's still an early access game.    TL;DR: Chucklefish spent five years on a game that they constantly removed assets from, dumbed down the story, broke promises for, and still can't decide whether their game should have new features added or not. Buyer beware, what you purchase now might very well be entirely different from what you own a year from now. ",-1,1

239820,Game Dev Tycoon,"This game is more of a history lesson through the years, rather than an actual game development simulator. Many of the combinations in the game are obvious, and the only real excitement you get is when you create a game that gets '10' reviews across the board from every 'reviewer'. These reviewers tend to be little ♥♥♥♥♥es, and before you ever create a perfect game, one of these little ♥♥♥♥♥es will give you a 9. You'll probably cry for a couple of hours like I did, but then you'll feel a little better and MAYBE replay it if you're feeling like you should be beat in the face a little more.  I mean, the game has good replayability value when it comes to perfecting your algorythm and getting that perfect game, but it's tough to enjoy the game at face value when everything tends to not only be the same, but also ridiculously predictable, whether it be console releases, or which console will be on top in the 'war' (SNES&gt;genesis, RIP dreamcast gone too soon, and N64&gt;PS1). There isn't a whole lot to discover in this game after you get three or so good combinations. It was too easy for me to continuously switch between sequels for my RPG 'ELDERLY WRITTEN PASSAGES' and my shooter 'Shut up mom, I'm in the middle of a match' and consistently get high ratings and drown in it (the cash, that is).  Overall, it's a fun experience the first time, especially if you don't remember the early console wars, but after that, the fun dwindles down. I give this one three little ♥♥♥♥♥ reviewers, and one midget ♥♥♥♥♥ reviewer out of five",1,1

214950,Total War: ROME II - Emperor Edition,Warning for this game is that you need to spend lots on your gaming rig. Closer to $1000 the better. There have been many problems with the game but in essence the game is fantastic. As a fan of the original Rome Total War it does live up to it's reputation. Mayble wait until all DLC's are out and the game has been patched to a satisfactory level. But it's playable at the moment and I've put in over a 100 hours of enjoyed immersion into antiquity era Rome :),1,0

279800,Grim Legends 2: Song of the Dark Swan,"Whilst not as good as Grim Legends, it's still a solid entry in this genre. Again, you play a female protagonist (this time the unnamed healer) as you amble through a retelling of a fairy tale, although given the choice of fairy tale this renders certain elements of the tale quite nonsensical.   Compared to the others by this developer I found this one relied a little too often on obscuring items with immovable objects which made them awkward to spot, but none of the puzzles, hidden object or otherwise, are too hard. The bonus chapter is set before the story but has no real relationship to it. I've gotta say I barely noticed the soundscapes, and where Grim Legends had a cute kitten, it felt like they'd tried to improve on that by offering you a variety of helpers throughout the game, but with such a short game and such infrequent use of the various companions it was hard to be too attached. Still they were all cute and the game is just fine. I suspect the it was the mangling of one of my favourite childhood tales that irked me slightly with this one.  Oh and the pronunciation of 'ginormous.'",1,0

Still requires some work, but I'm sure that the developers in this game will have it polished and done throughly. For the most part. I look forward to more factions such as pirates or Dong zhou's Liang forces which i saw in the game in pve.  I really love the work put into the soldiers on their actions such as when they are fighting, moving, standing and on stand by mode.   This game has some issues with logins connection, but I'm fairly sure they will fix it. If they add costumes like zi longs white armor I'll be sure to be spending on it haha.

277950,Deadbreed®,"I have played serveral matchs in dead breed and i can see the potential the game has but i simply cannot recommend this in its current state, the style of the game is very dark and its very pretty but it has two serious flaws that make it next to impossible to start up in the game. i have rarely came across a more money grabby game than i have saw in this, all the 'customisation' offered is locked behind a cash wall. you have silver and copper coins, silver is real money copper is in game money ever item costs several thousand coins from deadbreeds to items. silver coins are actually very expensive to buy compaired to how much you could buy in game with them. but my real problem is getting copper coins, i can only describe this process as obnoixous the most you seem to be able to make a game is a 100 coins give or take, considering every little thing in game costs several thousand coins and were talking about 20 minties a match i dread to think how much time a free player would have to sink into this to get anything worth while with there character going. this brings me along to the second problem with this game. the match making is just silly i have had one what i would consider fair match since i have played dead breeds.  every match i play allways has at least 1 guy who doesnt even need to look at the opposing team they are litterally so strong so well geared they can actually ignore the opposing team just kill out stuff and go afk my last game had a team rack up over a 100 point lead and i dunno go make a sandwich we were so weak the creeps were giving us a fight.  now i dont expect to start a new game and be the best or anything of that nature but its very hard to sit in a 20 minite match to actually have a team afk because your that meaningless to them for a 50 coin reward im totally comfortable with grind but this simply feels bad, the game seems to try and shoe horn you into buying in game items not to mention with the plateu of customisation its probley very easy to mess up and gear a character wrong etc. i hope this gets better i mean im used to obnoious cash shops im used to grind im not used to having a game tell me i have to go through mulitple 20 mintie matchs of getting stepped on to even buy one item that is a real put off for me. i spend money on things i enjoy not things i hope ill enjoy if i can buy my way to a point where im not getting crushed. this would be much more fun to play if they toned down how much it costs to get a playable character in a match and made there money off skins or cosmetics, i mean yes you can say this is not pay to win because all things are infact available in game, but this isnt pay for convinence either you should not have to grind like hell to even have a usable character most matchs you can barely even deal damage to the other team",-1,0

266210,One Way Heroics,"This game has to rank amongst one of my top most favorite rogue-like RPGS. With the first difficulty already being hard and the other difficulties and scenarios much harder than the previous one, this game makes you carefully plan your decisions (through movements, skills, choosing appropiate stats, and watching your three bars closely) in order to even get close to killing the final boss. All of the classes have a completely different playstyle (besides that most of them require you to use basic attacks to damage) to even get past the 100m mark. And although you start fresh everytime you begin a new character, the game rewards you by allowing you to keep a limit of items from past runs to aid your next. All of these elements combine to create a satisfacting experience that can be enjoyed by any RPG player and can consume time faster than you consume a bucket of KFC chicken. The soundtrack is worth a mention as well, fitting and worthy of rocking your head to the beat at the speed of the tempo. I would highly recommend this game to all RPG fans looking for a fair amount of difficulty, and recommend all casual players to give it a go as well. It's more than well worth its price of $3.49, so try this amazing masterpiece of a turn-based slightly pixelated RPG.",1,0
39510,Gothic II: Gold Edition,"ok, this game is janky as HELL. but my god it gets your hooks into you. a super long, super deep, super hard RPG that is impossible to put down. with a texture pack, it also looks great and has aged well. but MY GOD the controls are terrible, some of the quests are arcane and it's SO DAMN JANKY. but that jank gives it unbelievable charm.   grab the system pack here:  http://forum.worldofplayers.de/forum/threads/1340357-Release-Gothic-%C2%BD-%C2%97-SystemPack-%28ENG-DEU%29   it's necessary to fix a lot of bugs and engine problems and makes gothic 2 play nice with modern systems.  if you can stomach janky european RPG's, this is probably one of the best RPG's i've ever played. seriously, it's right up there with morrowind in my eyes.",1,1
233130,Shadow Warrior,"A cool game if it was 10 dollars. I got it on sale for 6 and expected a good game with cool melee animations (since it is usually 40 USD). But I was overall disappointed in the gameplay and animations. The gibbing (body parts flying off etc.) and the blood looks very cool in the trailer but when you are actually in game it feels kinda gimmicky and cheap. I honestly don't know how one charges 40 USD for this game. I realize that I have only like 100 minutes in this game but I stopped playing because I was getting bored of it. The story is slightly engaging but the gameplay feels very repetitive. It's pretty much cutscene, fighting, walk and loot crates for money and ammo, fighting, walk and loot crates for money and ammo, fighting, cutscene and so on. I couldn't even figure out if the swings of the kitana were just completely random swings or not. Meaning when you swing it feels like your character could do a swing to the left, or right, or down to up, or up to down. I felt like I had no control over how my character would attack the apponents. For example it was very difficult to land swings in the head for more damage when I had no way of knowing where my swings would come from or where I should aim for. The skill tree/ Ki tree or Karma tree or whatever is mostly your typical spend a skill point and now you can take 10% more damage. Or when your health is below 30% you do 30% more damage. Yeah yeah some people might say 'Well these upgrades are actually effective.' yes some of them are but I don't want to be spending all of my skill points on something that is just going to alter my stats. But there is an interesting powers tree where you spend Ki crystals or something to unlock more moves and Ki powers most of which are actually fun to use and have somewhat entertaining animations. The swordplay in my opinion should have much more detail, so should the blood effects. The gunplay in my opinion is very boring and the reload animations (actually all the animations in general) feel very boring and don't have much detail. With the exception of the revolver I actually did enjoy the revolvers animations they felt they had much detail unlike the PDW. I didn't have the chance to try out any of the other guns because I just stopped playing but from the small footage in the trailers they didn't look much different. And I was running this game on ultra settings 60+ fps so the lack of detail in the animations wasn't just the limitations of my hardware. But some upsides to this game in my opinion were the soundtrack. The soundtrack was actually great and fits the combat perfectly. The dialouge was just hilarious and constant jokes made by your character are just really really funny. I shouldn't be critiquing the story just because I have like 2 hours in the game but if I play this game more I may edit the review.  Keep in mind this is just my personal opinion and I apologize if you don't agree with it but I give it a 6/10. From what I've played. Keep in mind I realize I have like 2 hours in the game, but also keep in mind I stopped playing it because it was boring me. If you want a game that deviates from the repetitive first person shooter and have no regard for cost whatsoever then I guess this is a good idea. I may edit this review later but thx for reading it bye.",-1,0
22320,The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind,"Good: You are truly free to go wherever you want and do whatever you want.  The game world is incredibly rich and complex.  The main story is amazing, but there are also a huge number of side quests, which the game actively encourages you to explore. I didn't even get past the first mission of the main quest in my first year or so of playing.  Unlike the other TES games, you usually have to work hard to get the best gear, which makes it far more rewarding.   Bad: The graphics aren't the best, although that can be fixed with mods.  The combat system takes a bit of getting used to, although it can be very rewarding when you reach higher levels.   Overall, this is probably my favourite game of all time. The graphics and combat are quite dated, but if you can get past that, you are in for a fantastic open-world experience.",1,0

212010,Galaxy on Fire 2™ Full HD,"Not really a simulation and more of a casual game (but with some difficulty to it.)

205080,BIT.TRIP FATE,"So, this was my first Bit.Trip game and it really put the series on shaky ground with me.   Of course, I don't read directions or instructions, I just hit play. I did that with this game, and it worked well except I was trying way too hard to dodge things for a long time.  You play as Commander Video and you're on a rail type deal (that's the technical term) so you can only move forward and, by moving forward, you'll maybe go up and down depending on the rail. Your goal is to shoot anything that moves because it might shoot you first. I think.  The game has a very relaxing ambiance to it, despite it being pretty similar to many 'bullet hell' games. The music was relaxing and the voiceovers for powerups seemed very relaxed too. This is very interesting because the tone of the game seems very casual but you can die and take hits and lose points by losing your combo status thing (another technical term) very easily by being shot through the heart.   I can't say I enjoyed this game particularly, though. I think I got to the second boss before I got all the cards and moved on to a new game? Something like that. That's not to say the game isn't fun or anything, it's just the game lacked anything to suck me in. There wasn't anything that struck me as 'holy crap this is super fun I'm going to play this forever,' but rather the game was like 'Well, this is a reasonable way to spend my time.'   That said, this game is definitely among the most reasonable ways to spend your free time.",1,0

102500,Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning™,"the game is sort of odd in the beginning, you arent sure the base of how it plays and the story isnt so clear. once the intro and first few side and 2 or 3 main quests are completed the game falls into a comfortable setting and environment to play. it runs very much like a baby of skyrim and world of warcraft. there are a couple of classes and races to choose from and a distinct definition is given for what class uses what type of armor and weapons as you find the items throughout the game.  i would definately recommend this to someone who is starting out in an open world RPG as the mechanics of the game play easier and you will most likely not want to stop after the first hour or so of playing. I found that the game ran smoothly at around 60 fps around high and i have a gigabyte nvidia gtx 650 1gb GDDR5 card. i guess you can say the game is value for money  6.5 / 10",1,0

Upgrading skills and weapons/car fun too, except I'd maxxed out Max's skills before I'd even started Pink Eye's Territory, let alone Gastown. Downside: slightly repetitive side missions (eg eliminating mines), there is a formula in every region, so it can feel slightly grindy. Plus I am currently stuck at the Gastown race (part of the storyline) as I cannot seem to destroy that car far ahead.

263380,Driftmoon,"It's hard not to be charmed by Driftmoon, and that goes a long way towards making this somewhat straightforward, graphically modest game such a joy to play. The writing is infused with a very European sense of humour, and it wears its influences proudly. The story isn't particularly deep, but the characters are witty, eccentric and weird, including pirate-talking crabs and condescending panthers. It's all set in a rustic world that's packed with little details and witticisms, and while the graphics and art aren't going to set your world on fire, the simple physics and lighting system is enough to sell it. I thought its only weakness was the combat, which is best described as serviceable: click on monster and you (plus companions) auto-attack, with damage and attack speed based on your character's stats. You can also 'cast' various abilities and buffs to assist, but really there's not much strategy to it except at the higher difficulties, but that seems somewhat counter to the gently charming feel of the world for some reason. I was happy to move on from combat and continue the story, and meet another of Driftmoon's crazy inhabitants, then bumble along beaches and caverns looking for tantalising goodies. And if you like searching for hidden items strewn across the maps, behind doors and under tables, you'll be right at home.",1,0

The player character is an inhabitant of Vault 101, a survival shelter designed to protect up to 1,000 humans from the nuclear fallout. When the player character's father disappears under mysterious circumstances, the leader of the Vault initiates martial law and sends security forces after the player, who is forced to escape from the Vault and journey into the ruins of Washington, D.C. to track their father down. Along the way the player is assisted by a number of human survivors and must battle a myriad of enemies that inhabit the area, now known as the 'Capital Wasteland'. Fallout 3 is my all time favorite game I love it. fallout 3 pros are cool looking guns fun gunplay. cool looking armor fun sidequests cons laggy at spots main quest is too short not that many side quests bad gunplay.

49520,Borderlands 2,"This review has been updated for the Nominee   First let me explain why I wrote this title 'Stairs? Noooooooooooooooo!' This is a funny dialog in the last chapter in Borderlands 2 where you team up with Claptrap to defeat Jack. After eliminating tons of robots and Claptrap manages to access the door, stairs are just right before Claptrap. He's not able to climb stairs as he has no feet but wheels. If you're careful enough, you will understand this right away which has been mentioned in the beginning of the game. Hence I personally prefer this as the most noticeable symbol for Borderlands and especially, for the Claptrap, who is designed to be your reliable and adorable company during the entire game-play.   As for the game itself. Borderlands 2 would stand for the the peak of the series, since the pre-sequel is widely considered as a DLC instead of a new game. Borderlands 2 brings more playable and discoverable elements compared to the origin Borderlands. More variable weapons, characters, games within the game and remarkable scripts. In Borderlands 2, you will find the deep insights of the background, where the Vault Hunters from, their own stories, how the Pandora it works. And most importantly, you're gonna save the people.    Yes the review is personal and quite personal, but It deserves the awards I personally nominated to and I share it with the community. It's my 'Borderlands' and there must your Borderlands somewhere.

214560,Mark of the Ninja,"Mark of the Ninja is among the finest stealth games you can currently play, period.  While many such games claim you can play them how you want (read: lethally or non-lethally), this one truly delivers on the promise and provides extreme replayability through the abilities you unlock through play.   These abilities encourage exploration not only of the game space, but of your *play style*. It's incredibly satisfying as each play style wholly changes the way the game is played and – importantly – they all work and feel balanced!  All of these unlocked perks culminate in the highly recommended New Game Plus mode, in which the enemies get tougher, the simulated Ninja-senses even more realistic (no more super-human awareness of what’s going on behind you) but you’ve got access to your full arsenal of unlocked goodies right from the first stage.  The entire experience is incredibly well crafted!  PS. this is the game that proves quick time events can be used well.",1,0

221380,Age of Empires II (2013),"I remember playing this as a kid, before I got into games like Counter-Strike. Steam wasn't popular so this is what I would play.  The original game used to run on some low resolution, and was so obvious. The age of the title had something to do with it ;)  But as it was, it didn't really matter to me. I would love being able to sit down and do what I wanted to do. I didn't have to kill everyone off, I could get the 'artifacts' or build a wonder to win. Even the Regiside (kill the enemy king(s)) gamemode is a good gamemode.  Multiplayer isn't as good but it's nice to be able to play with friends again. With all RTS titles, it's whoever can rush the enemy the fastest. That's what bugs me about the multiplayer. If you can get over that, there's no major outstanding issues. ELO ranking has been added, but don't base your skill off of it.  Even though it may look like it supports old machines, there was a requirement for some new shader/texture thanks to the water. Not sure if it really is the water, but you need a dedicated card of some sort. Old Intel GMA graphics don't support it. So any reasonable card such as a GT 8600 or GT 9800 would make a great choice here.  7/10",1,0

This game have potencial but it's just short expierience game, the creator really wanted us to stay with that game so he added new game plus but still 15 normal missions which are sometimes annoing and 15+ missions with difference is just the most annoing enemy    rifle man    is more often AND he had new mehanic (making him even more annoing) which    i think    was only added on THIS NEW GAME PLUS (which basicly making strategy turn base game to bullet hell in TURN BASED GAME!!)

Pros: - Same nice Xcom athmosphere that many of us have come to love - It matters what you choose to research, and it's not as linar as Xcom - Turn based tactics on level with Xcom  Cons: - Maps get a bit too repetitive.

246280,Happy Wars,"Family friendly free to play moba; its like the Wizard101 for mobas.  Happy Wars is a sort-of MOBA but doesn’t fully embrace what defines the genre. There’s no creep here, replaced instead by a straight head-to-head 8 to 15-player teams constantly spawning and running into battle. Towers also function rather differently. Instead of actively trying to destroy any towers in their path players are working to build their own, where they can then spawn. Spawning ever closer via towers and/or going straight to the enemies base are both valid strategies.  But perhaps the biggest change is the simplification of classes. With each respawn, you’ll choose between one of three: The melee-focused Warrior, the healing and support Cleric, and the ranged damage Mage. Each class is fairly simple to play with excellent tutorials for each.   It speaks to a pleasure as primal as that found in other online mobas even if it's more overtly juvenile: this isn't about bloodlust as such and it's only nominally about a sense of conquest. Predominantly Happy Wars is all about camaraderie like that found in say Mount and Blade or Splatoon.  Voice chat remains off the cards - an omission that's understandable given the desire to provide a safe space to play. The Menu UI is a little in your face with pop-ups galore but its worth pushing through. Its also free-to-play which is great because of how accessible this makes it with little to no monetary investment.  Happy Wars is a machine for happiness where each element, charm, genuinely funny and cute tone has been engineered to elicit a smile holding fun at a premium.",1,0

You can take a group of people out into a horde of zombies fight twenty times in a row and never get scratched. And on the tewnty first time your entire team can die.  You can clear out a building, barracade it completly, fill it with traps and then move to another building to go exploring. Your boobytrapped fortress will be full of zombies.  I liked the diary aspect, I liked a lot of the concepts, but the game isn't very clear on what items do, or what anything means. I could never tell if I had a good chance or no chance at all of accomplishing a goal. I don't know what items were better to bring along or leave behind.  Even cheating I got my butt handed to me even though my entire team had been at full life up until that point.

It does come with amazing innovative ideas in the franchise gameplay, like the boosting, slams and low gravity, which you tend to miss if you go back to the old games. You get your class skill on level 1 and can use it almost all the time, which I think makes the game more dinamic and faster.  What I did not like about it is the dull story line. Don't get me wrong, it has amazing idea, but it's presented very slow. While I have over 5 compleate playthoughts of the stories in Borderlands 2, and I still go back to do new onces with diferent friends, it took me a while to go though the 3 vault hunter modes only because I was reminded of how dull the story is.  Leveling is a little off. We compleated the game (a friend and I), and tried to maximize our experaince gain of quests, and we are still not to the level cap. All vault hunter modes, main story quests and sidequests and still not maxed level.  When it comes to the DLC characters : Jack is more of a fan-based chracter - you play him because it's Jack. He is not the strongest and not the most fun character. The Baroness is, on the other hand, very fun to play, and can be quite strong. Yet it cannot match the other characters. And for her, was I willing to go all 3 vault hunter modes stories again? No.",1,0

292030,The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt,"9/10. I've not played previous Witcher games, or single player games recently. This has changed my opinion. The story is amazing, the choices you have are unlimited, the way you play the game can also differ from certain gear, talents and combat via dodge and waiting for an way in, or brute force. It may not have the best combat, though the story and interaction makes up for it. You find yourself liking the the main character where as other games let you create one, this gives you Geralt, which you can mesh your story around with the choices you make.   Not played a decent single player game in a long time, Fallout dropped out pretty quick for me, maybe it was the story (despite it not being played for that), this kept me hooked all the way through it.",1,0

384190,ABZÛ,"Although this game is very pleasant to look at and has a really good soundtrack, I didn't really enjoy it all that much and was kinda happy it was over so quickly (while simultaneously feeling it is overpriced for so little content). The puzzles are so basic, I refuse to call them puzzles. It's all just lock and key mechanics where you immediately spot the key everytime. And while you go where you're supposed to go you sometimes get annoyed by slow movement speed. The best moments in the game for me were when you swim alongside lots of fish in a stream and try to touch them to get speedboosts and though the main storyline is barebones, the little cutscenes were still entertaining to watch. It's a game about exploration but I feel there is not a lot of variety when it comes to stuff that you can find. You basically only trigger some animations that let different fish species appear. Yeah, I get it, the game is not inherently bad, it's just not my cup of tea. If you like walking simulators and don't mind the lack of gameplay, you'll probably enjoy it, but I still wouldn't recommend it because of the very short playtime.",-1,1
208650,Batman™: Arkham Knight,The game has been very fun for the hour or so I have played it but the optimization is so bad it ruins everything. On my high end system I run into FPS drops constantly. Driving the batmobile is the worst.  After disabling motionblur and depthoffield in the .ini file it runs much better but I would defintley hold off on purchasing this unless you have a great system and even then don't mind FPS drops.   Fingers crossed for a patch to come out asap.  I have been having a ton fun playing the game even with the occasional performance hiccup but if you're computer isn't high end I wouldn't take a chance until they patch it.,1,0

209160,Call of Duty: Ghosts,"The PC version of CoD: Ghosts is nothing but a joke, horribly unoptimized mess.  - Low Quality Textures on the Extra Image Quality setting. - Frame Rate Drops. - Stutters/Judders a lot. - Occasional Crashing - Audio Crackles and Pops when playing in Full Screen. - Frame Rate also cannot go above 91 without an FPS Unlocker from what I've heard. - Iron/Reflex Sights can get messed up like the Iron Sights getting stretched abnormally or the Red Dot Sights getting obstructed by weird grey triangle textures.  I've had to turn off many Graphics settings in-game, mess around with NVIDIA Control Panel, force the game to run at Normal Priority in Task Manager, run the game in Windowed Borderless and get a fan fix for the low res textures to make the game at least decently playable.  If your gonna get this latest installment of the Call of Duty series, I suggest getting it on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3 because you know why? Because it runs the best of every platform this game is on... yes even over the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of Ghosts because they have frame rate issues as well (Plus the Wii U version which has no DLC support aside from getting Free Fall in an update)",-1,0

337930,Nameless ~The one thing you must recall~,"Yet another great game with interesting storyline from Cheritz. I have thoroughly enjoyed the game and despite the seeminlgly high price, you kinda understand why this game costs this much when you consider the content and hours of gameplay you get out of it. I feel that there is more character development and hours of gameplay in Nameless than Dandelion, hence the higher price.  Personally, I prefer the characters from Dandelion more but Nameless is one of those games that you really grow to like the characters more as you proceed in the game. I also feel that Nameless has exceeded its predecessor in its plot by miles, which is incredible since the plot of Dandelion was already exceptional. I have to praise Cheritz for having such original and creative storylines that are so gripping and keep you up for nights just so that you can go through the whole game and see how they form a big picture together!   One criticisim is the english translation. I can certainly see improvements of the English translation since Dandelion but there are still, from time to time, some errors in both the grammer and spelling (tenses, difference between its and it's etc, typo like 'Soi' instead of 'so'). I am of course not by anyway saying that I am a master of the English language but if Cheritz wants to step up the game, I will highly recommend they have more people to do the proof reading (I saw the credit and understand that there are one translator and two proof readers already) and perhaps seek alternatives. I think it is something that Cheritz should honestly look into as the errors were, in my opinion, really distracting and make the game seem less professional, which is a great shame.   Same as Dandelion, there is a section that was not translated in English (the Christmas card messages in Dandelion and the bonus in Nameless). I know that for Dandelion, Cheritz has already said that they would not offer any translations. I think it's ridiculous as it surely would not take them that much effort to do so, plus we all paid for the game so shouldn't we all get what we ought to get? Even just post a translation on the website or something... If Cheritz is willing to just put in that extra effort then it will make us players more satisfied with the game and I hope Cheriz will consider that. Another small thing I would mention is that the female lead in this case doesn't have a voice-over, which I found a bit of a shame and I would recommend Cheritz to add it back on for the next game.  Overall, Nameless is a great game and it's great that Cheritz has taken players' comments into account when making it. I think it's great that there are multiple bad ends for each characters, increasing the hours of gameplay. Oh and how can I forget the references to Dandelion every now and then (I want that mug of all the Dandelion anaimals!!!) in the game and the end songs (sung by the characers) were awesome! Massive thumbs up to Cheritz---well done and keep up with the work and I look forward to what story twist you will think of to link all the characters' stories together (better not be by the wizard again as that will get old)! I can't wait till your next game!",1,0

If you enjoyed playing games from the Legend of Zelda franchise, or you're a fan of gameplay that rewards a mix of planning, adaptability, and quick reactions (as fostered by the Dark Souls franchise), then you'll definitely enjoy Hyper Light Drifter.

The game is pretty short , so there is not much to say. You can finish it in 1-3 hours. It has 3 levels and at the end of each level you fight a boss. It also has achievment support which is nice.

The mechanics tent to be somewhat obtuse, thus enhancing this impresssion, but there are some great community guides on Steam, so you really shouldn't worry about it. The controls are tricky at first, but when you get used to their quirks (you REALLY need to time 180° turns of your character), 'Abyss Odyssey' becomes a real barn-burner.

17410,Mirror's Edge,"When I read the reviews and whatched the trailers for this game, I thought this game would be awesome, but in my opinion it falls short. Let me explain why  Let us start with the art style. It gives us a very futuristic impression. The whiteness of everything and sudden bright colors every now and then look great. BUT. It is so white it starts to get annoying, it is just too bright. Even after playing around with the video settings you don't get much improvement.  On another topic, the gameplay: I understand inFAMOUS is a whole different type of game, but I could relate them because of all the zipline and rooftop jumping. I loved that rush and the feeling you get when you are running through buildings as fast as you can and you are thinking on-the-go where to jump next. But in Mirror's Edge this flow is kinda broken by the fact that your character sometimes achieves the stunts (wallruns, jumps, etc...) and sometimes she doesn't. It is really frustrating that sometimes she would hang from the ledge and some others she would do a wallrun and some others she would fall to her death. (which by the way, constantly falling to your death gets old really quickly). In some stages you don't know what Faith (the character) is capable of since the length and height of her jumps varies.  The AI enemies... There is something that is just not right. I don't know if they did it on purpose, but the AI starts super (SUPER) stupid, to the point that you can just run around them in circles and they won't hit you. But the longer you take on each chapter, the more aggressive they get, to the point that if you stand still for a moment, you are dead.  My last point, the 'open-ended' world. The game gives you the impression you can run everywhere and jump to the next building, whatever route it takes so you can reach your target... Nah... It just makes it more confusing to reach the route the game wants you to reach, the way it wants you to reach it. This is kinda ok, otherwise the game would be too easy.  I only played for a couple of hours and a few chapters but this game has disappointed me, I cannot say much about the storyline, only that it started off being interesting. Anyways, I already requested my refund...  tl;dr &gt;too white &gt;stupid enemies &gt;stupid character",-1,0

360730,Cards and Castles,"LOL is this game serious ? I'll put a pros and cons list shall I... Pro's, free to play and rather intriguing at first. Cons, and there is a few of them when you really start playing it properly. So first of all the micro transactions are very real. For you to open a booster pack would take nearly an hour of grinding for example. The objectives at first are rather easy and you get a few booster packs here n there but good luck getting something good you can use... On top of this it takes nearly 2000 of these coins that you earn to open one single booster pack that contains 5 cards which are completely random. Secondly it literally forces you to play certain factions or you will literally lose. If you don't play the other factions you get nothing but really bad cards over and over again. I'm talking I went down to around 10 'castle' damage before I even got a creature out on the board..... TWICE. I laughed so hard at this pathetic attempt to force you to try out all the factions. These games are about diversity and you've took that away aswell as stuck a bunch of micro transactions inside it. I even tried to go online for my first time, is there any sort of skill based match making ? Is there hell! There is a ranked based match making but I couldn't play that without my own deck which funny enough I didn't have enough cards to make said deck... You see where I'm going right! So I went onto friendly thinking everybody would be on about the same level as me with the same cards... NOPE. No such luck. I literally got put up against somebody who had epic cards at nearly every draw and I got 3 creatures out on the board before he was already attacking me..... I tried out the campaign. I had to use my 'CP' that I had earned grinding through the pathetic attempt at forcing me to play each faction. Literally half my CP and I thought, okay then there must be some kind of reward at the end of it... Please don't be stupid. You end up with around 250 extra CP. Even though this game is completely dependant on the draw of your hand the computer gives no Eff's. Just starts throwing out cards that have abilities like 'do critical damage.' This is not worth the 250 cp that would be grinding for around 1 and a half hours+  So you ask me do I recommend a game that is riddled with microtransactions and boarderline senseless acts at trying to force them on me ?   Would I hell...",-1,0

287700,METAL GEAR SOLID V: THE PHANTOM PAIN,"My personal experience with this game is awfully complicated.  The gameplay itself is astonishing, with the player being able to use a wide variety of options to tackle the objective provided. AIs are responsive and the overall game mechanics deserve some praises. Tag that along with stunning graphics and a compelling historical setting = Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain.  Although the game truly excels in some areas, there are sadly plenty of room for criticisms. 1. The characterization aspect of the game is poor 2. The 'open world' of the game lacks interesting areas and is uneventful 3. Although there are many gun customizations, options concerning Mother Base, staff memebers, and multiplayer settings are very limited 4. Too many loose ends and unexplained phenomenons 5. Overall, the game feels incomplete; especially with the 'repeat missions' in the closing chapter of the story   I feel that this game had the potential to become the best game ever in its genre. Unfortunately, because the gameplay is so impressive, the areas that lack stand out. Nonetheless Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain is a great dynamic game that might slightly dissapoint you, but is still worth the while and a serious contender for the best game of the year.",1,0

200010,Quantum Conundrum,"Quantum Conundrum is a FPS puzzle platformer. You are the grandson or uncle, can't remember, of a scientist who has trapped himself in some dimension. You need to reset some generators to rescue him.  To achieve this goal you use different mechanics like freezing time, making objects heavier or lighter and something else I never got to use as I gave up on the game. It's fun at first but I was bored with the game a littel after starting the first generator. A lot of it felt like the same old thing just different room. Plus a lot of it looks exactly alike.  The game is challenging and could be enjoyable for some. I don't care for the FPS platforming cause it can become very irritating. If you like good physics puzzles and can handle FPS platforming than try the game out. It did seem well made but it's just not to my liking.  Bear Rating 7/10",1,0

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"As with most reviews, this is steeped heavily in personal opinion and not much else, but here goes:  Today, this game is mediocre. But it was kinda good once.  48~ of my 56 some odd hours in this game were spent in 2012 when this game first hit Steam. It was fun back then; not great, but still entertaining. But most importantly, there was a huge opportunity for improvements in the coming years, which I was very keen to see (and still have yet to).  The most recent 8~ hours I've played have been far below the expecations I had for progress made in 3 whole years of development; really, if anything, the current state of the game is a straight  retrograde  from the 2012 iteration. Hit detection issues have against all odds gotten worse, almost all the combat exploits are still here, the community has gotten  far  worse, and it seems like very little new content exists now that didn't exist 3 years ago. I mean, I guess the new menus and hats are nice, oh and you can change your armor color to confuse people by obscuring what was previously a clean 'red vs blue' combat environment, but...  The array of weaponry, for example, seems identical. Sure, you have a bunch of reskins for real $$, but they're functionally identical to weapons which already existed 3 years ago. I can understand why adding more weapons just for the sake of more weapons is a recipe for disaster balance-wise, but really guys? Three whole trips around the sun and nothing?  The minority community of insular elitists has somehow blossomed since 2012, and what's worse is that it seems the developers only cater to this demographic when updating the game. This is why flat-out exploits like mouse dragging or bunny-hopping during sword fights still exist: long-time players have been using these as a crutch for so long that making the game work  without them  hasn't even been considered.  Additionally, the populated servers all seem to suffer from high degrees of what I call 'Garry's Mod-itis', where server admins go on power trips and break their own server rules pretty much constantly. A catastrophic lack of maturity is a recurring theme.  The most positive thing I can say about this game is that the tutorial is really well designed, probably one of the more content-rich tutorials I've encountered. It's too bad that the majority of the stuff you learn in it can be safely thrown out the window once you actually start playing multiplayer, because of the aforementioned exploits completely eclipsing all other strategies.  I guess what I'm trying to say is: if you want to play a melee-only TF2/Enemy Territory-style objective game that is completey mired in a cluster♥♥♥♥ of exploit-dominated playstyles, where new content drips in at a rate of 2-hats-per-year, and whose community of server mods/admins make Hitler look like a sensible and level-headed dude (come on, you know Godwin's Law had to fit in here somewhere), then dive right in.  But if you're looking for an even semi-realistic portrayal of medieval combat in a multiplayer videogame, with deep but rational gameplay and a mature community, and furthermore whose developers actively develop it to  improve  its gameplay and appeal, rather than sheltering and encouraging a vocal minority of elitist shitheels who can't function without garbage exploits, then you'll need to look elsewhere.",-1,0
395200,Ben and Ed,"Nothing about this game feels finished. It's very polished visually, but the controls feel both sluggish and yet flighty. Momentum is a huge part of this game, and yet platforming needs to be done in places where the player doesn't have room to judge their own speed. The ragdoll physics are attrocious, on the first boss in particular. My first ten minutes were tolerable at best, but facing the clown for 20 minutes was unbearable. It's shockwave attack affects the player while in the air, sending him or her into endless cycles of floating in the air. It was unplayable at worst, extremely enraging at best. Respawn points are not safe as well, leading to cycles of respawning into attack and dying immediately.  Turning is very difficult, coordinating the camera is extremely difficult, momentum is incorporated and yet not accounted for in level design, and the ragdoll physics is much too intense. I feel genuinely bad writing this review, as I only cleared five of the six first stages, but the game was too unplayable. I could not complete the first level.   I do not recommend this game and am also asking for a refund.",-1,1

My favortie features are how well the game has been made, it is not an alpha half polished turd, and furthermore the gun customnization options are exeptional. With any one of the pre determined 'class roles' you can choose a variety of playstyles, long range, support, close range, technical, all within one class. Furthermore, the graphics are good and the community and gameplay (no real rank system) means that the gamaing will always be a chill experience. Overall the gaming experience and utility that this game provides, well reinburses you the 15 dollar purchasing price. Would highly recomend.",1,0

349040,NARUTO SHIPPUDEN: Ultimate Ninja STORM 4,"Important info before doing my review.  CPU: i5 3670k ( 3.40GHz ) GPU: GTX 670  I have not played the story mode yet. Just been doing online, and versus.  --- I normally don't do reviews, and I doubt my review will even be seen, but with the game getting bashed so hard. I wanted to give my opinion. I had the game preordered, and saw the reviews were terrible, I was scared the game was going to be bad, and run badly. So I started up the game. And so far my experience with the game has been quite nice. I haven't had any of the issues others have had really. Maybe I'm just lucky.  There are some small problems with this game like audio, and the fact that we have to go through the config files to actually change some options. But they can easily be (and hopefully are) patched. And even with the small problems, I don't think it deserves to get slammed like it is now.  From what I have seen a lot of people having problems with the game don't even meet the min requirements for GPU and/or CPU. There are exceptions of course of people with great cpus, and GPUs like 970s+ having problems.(Maybe is somehow more optimized for older GPUs? Idk). But again from what I have seen on the discussions page, a lot of the people complaining don't meet the requirements for this game at all. I think people just assumed because they could run Naruto UNS3, they could run this game as well or something.   In closing, the game isn't a bad port at all, BUT at the same time, it isn't a very good port either. It's pretty average, but the fanbase is making it seem like it's Batman AK.  If you actually meet the requirements of this game and want the game, buy it, you should be fine, and if not somehow, well at least steam refunds is a thing.   P.S. I've also played this on my friend's computer with a gtx 960, and it ran fine as well.",1,1

Or how enemies with elemental resistance explode into an AOE of whatever damage type they have a resistance to, so I hope you aren't playing a melee character.

The art style and music create a very nice atmosphere, and the controls are fairly smooth. Most of the special abilities you get are very creative and fun to use, my favorite being the buzzsaw. There's not a lot of tutorials or hints, but there's an objective marker and you get an info tool you can point at things to find out how to interact with them.  All-in-all it was a very good game in my opinion and it's only about 8 hours to play through the entire game and find all of the collectibles. I recommend picking it up sometime.",1,0

325610,Total War: ATTILA,"* This is a review in progress, for it's too early for me to review this game fully*  Total War: Atilla is almost nothing like its Predecessor, Rome 2. In my opinion, Rome 2 was not a terrible game. Rome 2 was just plagued with bugs that got ironed out too little too late. Rome 2 was overall a good game. Atilla is taking a good game that is Rome 2, and making it great.  Pros: - The graphics are a step up from Rome 2's, and the color palette is more realistic, with a bit of Early Dark Ages thrown in the mix.  - Migrations and Hordes work marvelously. You can scorch the earth so your enemies get nothing, and become nomadic, looking for a new place to call home. This is what makes the Huns and the factions among The Great Migration so unique and frankly fun to play as. Also, the Huns can't capture territory, but they can Sack, Raze, Subjugate, and utturly destroy their enemies.  - Make no mistake, Total War: Atilla is unforgiving on the difficulty. You thought playing as the Eastern or Western Roman Empires would be easy? Think again. They have numerous enemies, overstretched borders and overstretched militaries. But that's the fun of playing as them. Maybe you, the player, can rewrite history. This can be a Pro or Con depending on the person, but this is a hugo Pro for me. Rome 2 was way too easy.  - Grand campaign is a lot more interactive than Rome 2's. It sort of reminds me of Total War: Medieval's grand campaign where historical events would happen (i.e the rise of the Mongols). Objectives are not useless either in Atilla, in Rome 2 they were somewhat useless, and the objectives can be challenging depending on the player.  - Political intrigue has been overhauled as well, sort of going back to the Shogun 2 way of doing things, which is great. Whether it be royal marriages, embezzlement, promoting a statesman to a position of honor, or a family member to goverern a province, you can find ways to pass time while at peace.  - The overhauled Raze option after taking a city is awesome. You can obliderate a city, watch that section of the map burn with fire, and it is uninhabitable without recolonizing it. So fun to use in Campaign mode.  Cons: (most of these issues are fixable given time)  - I don't know why, but for me I occaisionaly have screen tearing occur in Atilla. It happens rarely fortunately, but it can get annoying while seeing the screen start to get cut up. Restarting your game gets rid of this issue, for some reason.  - while waiting for your turn to begin again, or even right when it begins, the game has a chance to freeze, or crash. It's happened to me about 4 times already. Hopefully this is another issue that is to be fixed.  In the end, Total War Atilla is worth 45 dollars, and I give it two thumbs up. You'll be occupied with Atilla for many hours to come, as I already am.",1,0
371660,Far Cry Primal,"One big aspect of this game being a great time is that you have all the makings for a story of your own. Yep, role-playing. Not using shortcuts, taking everything off the UI on screen, already you'll find the game more interesting. Now, decide to only play as realistically as you would if you were there. You wouldn't stand in the middle of their camp and hope to shoot them all first. I get the Owl out, recce ahead, plan my moves two or three ahead. I find the outter enemies of an encampment or whatever the best to pick off first, just as I would in real life. I summon my stealthest beast. The stragglers get eaten without out any alarms. You know what Im getting at. This game is a fantastic open canvas of how ever you like to play. I was about to refund this game, but I decided to try realistic style approach. No helps, no exploits, no cheesy running in and taking your chances. You wouldn't do that in real life. But in this game does it ever bring in the suspension of disbelief.   Give it a good try. The game becomes all that you wished it would do for you. But this is a game you play close to the bone, and it comes alive. I'm 24% through, and 30 hours into it. I have 3/4 of a game left, and I'm already not wanting it to end. There is just so much you can do in this game, but it will take a choice on your part. Are you willing to put a bit of effort into it, or moan, because the Dev's have left something out that you feel makes the game poor. Not a chance, This is a polished, smooth running, innovative aspects of stealth, pet taming, etc. Brilliant. Can't wait to see where this goes.   Developer's, thanks you for a wonderful labour of love youve put into your game. The details prove that over and over, that this game shines, and its ready for prime-time gameplay, for me anyway.

But if you just got the game for the Team Duel like me, leave it....",-1,0

217200,Worms Armageddon,"I don't think I have to explain what one of the most famous PC games of all time is, do I? I'll just skip that part.  While Armageddon is growing a bit dated in its appearance, it is still the best worms Team 17 ever made, in this reviewer's opinion. Out of all the worms games, Armageddon is one of the better games in terms of customization options and number/balance of weapons. It also has great mobility for the worms, including really crazy physics-defying uses of the ninja rope, if you get good at using it. But one of the biggest factors for my preferring Armageddon over all other installments in the worms franchise is the size of the battles. Armageddon lets you create much bigger teams than other Worms games, and you can therefore have a greater number of worms on the map at a given time. This gives you a lot more tactical options per match, but also improves those crazy moments where you explode a holy hand grenade and six worms go soaring through the air in all directions.  Armageddon also boasts a really fun and challenging set of story missions that challenge you in a variety of ways. Usually there is either a puzzle element to the mission or else it challenges you to think about a particular weapon or skill in a new way. It is very fun to go on a one-worm infiltration style mission, for example. Or there is another mission where you have one worm with 10hp and have to kill an enemy worm with 150hp who is hiding in an underground cave with no entrances, and you have to figure out how to kill him (without getting killed yourself) within a certain number of turns. It requires a lot of retries and experimentation, but you get it eventually. Challenges like these are an excellent change of pace to the typical all-out deathmatch.  Buy W:A and enjoy your holy hand grenade.",1,0

290890,You Must Build A Boat,"This is a sequel to 1,000,000, building out on the leveling and RPG aspects while keeping the gameplay the same. Which means you will continue to face frantic strategic match-three gameplay, as you try to make useful matches when encountering obstacles to be enemies and open chests. It's amazing how well the concept works; it really does feel like an action game more than a puzzle game, though it serves both purposes. It's not easy, but the expanded options and purchases do give you a better shot, it seems. I was stuck on the last section for at least an hour (just not quite fast enough), and there's lots more replayability (you collect monsters, and several take special situations to get - I missed at least a half dozen in my playthrough). It's a weird mix of game styles, but it's very good at what it does.",1,0

399120,Prospekt,So yeah Prospekt is a sequel to Half Life: Opposing Force and 2 words its good. However they are some little nitpicks and problems. 1. Okay here is a nitpick so when I play this game I don't feel like Adrian Shepard I just feel like a dude in a H.E.V Suit and I know that it has so camo on it but it just doesn't feel like Adrian Shepard (you know the gloves and the no sleeves on the arms) 2. It's confusing where to go but its not like that other game *cough* Wilson Chronicles *cough* only two times it was confusing thats it. Well other than those 2 reasons this is really good go check it out (but be careful because the Combine are difficult) Anyways probably rate it 7/10.  EDIT: Just saying the rating of 6/10 of Prospekt makes sense (I probably give it 7/10 look see I changed the rating so).,1,1
252330,Slender: The Arrival,"If I had to describe this game in one word, it would be 'Flawed'. It's not a terrible game by any stretch of the imagination, absolutely not - it definitely takes what The Eight Pages has done, and makes it even better, upping the spooks, the immersion, the atmosphere, and the detail as well as adding a nicely knit story (well, nicely knit for Slenderfans familar with vlogs like Marble Hornets and TribeTwelve, anyway) into the mix. There are some definitively terrifying scenarios there - being trapped underground with something chasing you, or having to close all the doors and windows in your house in the hopes that  something  doesn't get in. The game design, the game soundtrack, and the character models are all detailed and gorgeous, making you feel like you're really stuck in the woods alone as the sun goes down. The soundtrack really is stellar, seriously, you owe it to yourself to listen to it at least once - its ambient, eerie tones and soft undercurrents of dread really set the mood. Easily one of the best video game soundtracks of all time in my opinion.  However, the game is still, very much so, flawed.  Why say it's flawed? Well, the premise of the game is the same idea we have seen so often in Slenderman games - run around, collect things, get jumpscared by Slenderman, rinse, repeat. The game definitely tries to frame this formula in a different light with different scenarios, but I suspect many people will not be able to get over the fact that the first three or four levels, barring the prologue, have you locating items and collecting them while all the while Slenderman is after you, or the Proxy is after you, or both. To be fair, the game does now, after the update, have about as many collection as non-collection levels to it, making it more even-handed, but it still relies on jumpscares, and that's where the other part of its flawed nature comes in. Jumpscares can be done well, or done very, very poorly. Whether or not you think the game handles it well or poorly is a matter of subjective interest, as everyone reacts to jumpscares differently. Generally, people who like Slenderman stories are also people who like jumpscares and psychological horror, and this game treads the line between those two falteringly. Chances are if you're not a Slenderfan, not influenced by jumpscares or dislike them entirely, or do not find psychological horror that frightening, you will not like this game. At all.  So do I recommend this game? Overall, yes - if you're a Slenderfan and you like jumpscares. For the Slenderfans in the audience, there is a lot of backstory there, and it being written by the same crew as Marble Hornets is sure to make you bring to mind that vlog's most famous, eeriest scenes while playing the game. For those who find the idea of being hunted and toyed with frightening, or the concepts the game is trying to get across frightening - like being trapped someplace with something dangerous, or being followed by something malicious - there's a lot to like here. However, if you just do not find Slenderman, jumpscares, or psychological horror of the kind Slendy is known for frightening, you aren't going to enjoy it, and there's little the game can do to convince you otherwise. It's kind of like a found-footage film - the way it's designed and shot is not for everyone, the way its story plays out is not for everyone, and the tropes in it are definitely not for everyone. The game is fun, and definitely a decent horror game, but it's flawed. Whether or not that flawed nature adds to its charm or chafes you to no end is a matter of opinion.",1,0

250900,The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth,"This game is about a child who either A. Is running away from his mother who is trying to kill him or B. Running away from his mother who he THINKS is trying to kill him. You play as a child named Isaac, however there are other characters, and you kill monsters with your tears. There are many (400+!) items you can use to defeat monsters and kill bosses, etc in the vast labyrinths you will travel. The game is very lengthy with each run on average, when everything is unlocked, taking about 45+ minutes and there being 2 billion+ different labyrinths you can traverse, which each being very different to the last. The game never ends. You will never cease to like it. Buy it. Why? Well, it is good and made by Edmund-freaking-McMillen. BUY IT NOW.

237990,The Banner Saga,I enjoyed the game and the strategy was fun. Unfortunately the end of the story left a lot to be desired with no actual plot threads being resolved other than one dead guy and a different ending depending on just one random question response you gave 2 fights prior to the last battle. Would have liked to see a better resolution and an after game narrative or some way to carry on and improve the cool characters you recruited along the way.  Also more storyboarding would have been nice. So many things were displayed just by talking heads (with torsos) or dialogue boxes that made me feel really underwhelmed reading about how my favourite warhawk lost his life for no real reason... They could have made it so that characters that died in battle really died and then make the other choices more obvious and predictable. At one time I was offered a chance to 'Help my friend pull up a cart of supplies' at which point he fell to his death with supplies in tow. Bit weird since I chose the option to help him...,1,0

380020,Three Heroes,"MOTHER RUSSIA. HEROS OF RUSSIA. This game is a cultural history lesson on Russian mythology. or Slavic to be exact. The Mother land is under attack by bandits and ruffians and well just badguys. Starting with the archer hero Alesha you join up with the other 2 heros by doing missions and learning the diffrent fighting styles of each hero. Illya is a sword and sheild kinda guy and Domrynya is a ''shaft'' its is called, user. Collect weapons and items in true RPG style sence and level up the heros to fight and get rid of the filth in the Motherland. Full of missions/quests on maps or areas to complete with lots of story. Switiching between heros and using their unique abilities is key to some of the missions. It makes it puzzle like sometimes. A little gimic with the usage of 3 main characters. I like. They will kill and maim all bandits eventually. They shall find a way .... I think that that cool part of the game is the cultural story of telling you or giving you an idea what these Slavic myth heros were suppose to be like. The music is on que with the cultural and diffrent but enjoyable and the graphic art style is well artsy. ''Comic '' like. This isnt all dark and grimy like The Witcher or Darksiders solo RPGs. Its a good intro for upcoming video gamers like my own 10 year old for exp. Thel get into it and learn how these games work.

436500,Diaries of a Spaceport Janitor,"This game is great! Though some people may not like it's visual style, or the routine bound gameplay; would it really be better if the devs developed those areas any more? C'mon, you're a janitor.  Every morning you wake up along with your floating companion (that you eventually want to get rid of) and stare out the window overlooking the spaceport. It could be sunny or absolutely pouring out. Down there are weird species bustling about with odd variations from walking televisions, to red stickmen with pulsating heads. You then shove a piece of rusty scrap metal into your pants hoping that someone you meet will buy it, and obtain your meager earnings from burning trash; then venturing out to do exactly that. Burn trash.   Though along the way you may find yourself rubbing up against a sword for good luck, praying to gods, collecting fetishes, changing your entire gender so you don't glitch out of reality. You will gawk at stupidly overpriced food, sell that scrap metal for 12% of its original price, give containers to a containerphile, listen to local alien bands, and accidentally incinerate lucky charms and living things. All whilst you look up into the sky, seeing all the spaceships dart about like free souls. You often wonder to your simple janitor yourself,   'Will I ever be up there amongst them?'  This game forces you to embrace who you are. Being a janitor here is difficult, you have to manage yourself carefully just to make sure you're fed everyday. You have to occasionally change your gender to stop from phasing out of existence, and sometimes guards may approach you when you're not aware and literally eat a good 20% of all the money you have. You eat, burn trash, sell trash, burn trash, eat again, burn trash, sleep, and then repeat. Only diverging once in a while to pursue your dreams of getting out of this noisy, dirty spaceport that sadly can't clean itself. Hovever not sticking to your job can deplete your money real fast, and so time and time again you will have to return to it. It reminds yourself that at the end of the day, until you get off this planet, you're just a janitor.   Crystalline/Dirt, would change gender to 'Cryogene' again.",1,1

362960,Tyranny,"Why people demand games in this genre to be 100 hours long is beyond me. Having played Baldur's Gate 2 right before this I was happy to have a more compact experience that didn't outstay its welcome. Familiarity breeds contempt, especially when the novelty of the setting, the diverse world building and how it handles morality is really the one thing it brings to the table.  If there's one major criticism I can level at the game it's that the story - as opposed to world building and lore - is severely lacking, especially for the standards of an Obsidian game. It chugs along quite nicely until a story point where you're forced to pick a side or remain unaligned and that's really all there is to it. The rest of the game is spent entirely on mopping up your opposition. Even the amount of choices to make allies or use intrigue against your enemies is severely limited after that point, just in case you thought maybe the game had more simulationist than storytelling aspirations.  Still, it's a good experience though I doubt it will be a very memorable one. I hope it receives a sequel to actually make use of all the world building to tell a good story.",1,0

400,Portal,"You're waking up in a strange facility, with someone telling you that you'll be a test subject. Indeed, you'll have the limited right to try the Portal Gun, a device that creates portals so that you can easily go from a point to another. You're up for many test chambers... but are you really?  Portal was bundled in the Orange Box, where you found Half-Life 2, HL2 Ep 1 and the Episode 2, only released at first in it and Team Fortress 2. It was very interesting at the time, because of the gameplay/ It was a game based on reflexion and solving puzzles with portals.  However, that new way of playing had a real impact: indeed, you're not using portals only for travelling but also for flinging to reach higher places, which requires sometimes a great sense of timing and placement. Besides, the rooms are also dangerous as toxic water is also present. And if you want to get out, you'll have to jungle with buttons, some activating something for a few seconds, cubes to put on big red buttons, fields destroying your portals, turrets that are speaking, etc..  And at the end, GLaDOS, the A.I. behind your testing, is also revealed to be uncontrolable. You can hear her making comments that can be hurtful but she's the master of lying - you don't know what is true or false. You, on the other hand, have no clue on who you are apart that your name, Chell. And someone else has also lived behind the scenes, known as Ratman.  Portal is also pushing you to love a crate with an heart on it, The Weighed Companion Cube, known as WCC. While it's not really impacting your own story, it is tied to Ratman. So, yeah, by finding all the little easter eggs in the game, you'll see a big universe... and you know what? Portal is tied to Half-Life's world. It's not a secret anymore that Aperture Sciences is a rival of Black Mesa.  Anyway, the graphics are done with the Source Engine, so anyone used to them will love Portal. True, given the fact that every test chamber are white, grey or perhaps black, but after a while, you'll see another side of the facility.  The soundtrack is also a strong point, mainly the ending song Still Alive.  Portal is really enjoyable. While there is no co-op campaign like in the sequel, you have challenges to beat like less number of steps, the faster or the less portals.  I must say that if you don't have any patience for puzzles, you can pass your way. Otherwise, you can dive into Portal's world.  Oh and maybe Black Mesa....",1,0
204300,Awesomenauts,"Awesomenauts is a fast paced brawl type game you can play with up to 3 people in a 2d side scroller. The game overall is one of the most unique games i've seen yet. This game however has so many things wrong with it i just can not find anymore enjoyment. Over the amount of time i've played, i tried each character multiple times and found many things.  There are so many issues with Awesomenauts, it's horrid. There are normal complaints about the game like a typical moba would recieve, but this game gets special complaints due to it's aspect.  This game i would not reccomend if you are returning or first picking up. Please do not. Unless you want to get placed in unfair matches with people who know far more superior tactics than you, you'll be left behind spending hours upon hours just learning the game. The spawn, where you have to control a little ship to collect the currency which is called solar is fantastic, but new players have absolutely no idea what is going on. The patterns are different from map to map, but this also makes it even harder for new or returning players to pick up on. The starting solar allows you to get a what is basically worth a kill. When you die, you lose 30 solar which isn't a terrible amount, but it does really hurt. It effectively puts the enemy team ahead 160 solar ahead due to each player getting 30 solar for killing someone, then 40 extra solar to whoever killed that person, and finally the person that died loses that 30 solar which equals the 160 solar. After a couple kills, say about 5, your team is behind 800 solar. It's insanely difficult to ever come back in a game like this. Just the solar amount is so unbalanced, a single kill can honestly make or break the game.  The match making in this game is borderline OK. If it were to be any worse, i don't think this game would be playable. I'm constantly being placed in matches where people live many miles away, recieving a lot of ping. This causes host advantage. Basically if your not the host, or they aren't close, good luck. Especially with all the debuffs that can be applied to a person, you'll be so locked down, you might as well surrender. Also you can join a game where it will basically be ending. You can literally drop leagues so fast and it would be impossible to do anything about it.  The characters in this game however are fun and have their own playstyle, they're unbalanced. A lot of people disagree with this, but some characters are just a little OP. Characters like clunk, skolldir, and derpl have larger bodies so they have a larger body block potential. This makes large mass characters have a huge advantage, where as people like Vinnie, Gnaw, and Leon much harder to body block. Now i'm not saying Body mass is what makes a person OP, it's just it gives them an advantage. Some higher damage people like raelynn, leon, and froggy, all do massive amounts of damage, but some just do more in general. Vinnie has a very high damage dash that is an AOE which could effectively be x3 damage of it's base damage instead of just 1. Vinnie alone can reach insane amounts of damage. Leon is supposed to be a stealthy assassin, but he really doesn't do a whole lot of damage since almost any debuff he recieves destroys his playstyle. he heavily relys on his basic attacks which is basically leon in a nut shell, but he does about the same amount of damage with his basic attacks as a vinnie. I could honestly make a massive list of just all the unbalanced things, it'd take a long time to make.   TL;DR: Awesomenauts is unique, and fast. It's a 2d side scrolling brawl game supports up to 3 people on either team. New or returning players are heavily punished for not spending time in the game. Matchmaking, majority of the time is terrible, and no dedicated servers. Unbalanced match making, making it unfair for new and returning players to play. Unbalanced characters. A single target damage dealer does effectively 2x-3x less damage than A AOE target damage dealer",-1,0

The game is based on cooperation so i don't advise playing the game alone it doesn't look like so much fun. Goes from 2 to 8 players, the fun starts with 2 players when you gotta plan attacks accordingly and help each other to survive in the hostile universe; The difficulty is pretty high so i don't think casual RTS players would really feel at ease on this game but hey for the price it costs just give it a go.

It's definitely worth it to pick up the DLC too since Fall of the Samurai is absolutely awesome! Rise of the Samurai was pretty bland though and I wouldn't recommend that.

417860,Emily is Away,"It's alright for a free-to-play game. However, I was expecting to receive more than what I actually got.  First of all, the typing mechanism is pretty much useless. You just mash random buttons to spell out pre-determined words when conversing with Emily. Either just have the dialogue choices be a simple click and that's it, or let the users get to type in their own questions for Emily.  Second, your choices DO NOT MATTER. There are only two endings, one of which is Emily ending the discussion in Chapter 5 very abruptly if you treated her terribly in Chapter 4. The other one, which most of you will probably get on your first try, is pretty much the standard ending to this game. You and Emily's friendship ceases to exist. She goes back to dating her ex-boyfriend, so there is no way for your character and Emily to end up together. Then your 'friend' Mike starts dating this girl Emma that you meet at college (you'll meet Mike and Emma at whatever college you choose to go to), so there is no way to end up with Emma. In the end, no matter how nicely you might have treated Emily, your kindness goes unappreciated. Emily comes off as a real manipulative ♥♥♥♥♥ who takes out all of her frustrations on you for no good reason. She asks to come over and see you and then later accuses you of taking advantage of her when she was in a very vulnerable emotional state.   Third, why couldn't the player message anybody else on their friends list? The player gets to see other people's profiles, such as Mike and Emma, and yet there is no option to even just send a quick 'hello'. That's some missed potential right there.  If this wasn't a free-to-play game, I'd strongly suggest you all to not purchase this game. Since it is free however, play it if you want, but there is no replay value.",-1,0

206440,To the Moon,"I came late to To the Moon. As a game that’s cheap to begin with and frequently on sale, I bought it early in 2015 and didn’t get around to playing it until December of 2016. After starting it and playing through it all in one night because I couldn’t bear to step away, I can say with absolute conviction that it is not a game to be missed.   To the Moon is a game about love and loss, telling the story of a complex and bittersweet romance from its very end to its very beginning. Without giving too much away (as each moment of it is distinctly touching and impactful in its own way upon in-game discovery), the story’s themes are extremely reminiscent of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, exploring the true nature and complexity of love as well as the value and effect of memory. You play alternatively as doctors Eva Rosalene and Neil Watts as they use a futuristic machine created by their employer, Sigmund Corp., to fulfill the last wish of the initially mysterious Johnny Wyles, an elderly man on his death bed. Sigmund Corp.’s machine allows Rosalene and Watts to travel backwards through Johnny’s memories – starting with his last – and alter his recollection of his life so that he ends up fulfilling his dying wish.   While To the Moon’s simplistic point-and-click gameplay and some minor mechanical annoyances (such as the pointer still showing options for interaction with people and things during non-interactive cutscenes) might leave some to be desired, the narrative and soundtrack more than make up for it, allowing players a glimpse into the complexity of a lifelong love and all of its warmth, twists, and regrets. Even the art itself, from the character sprites to the lighting effects to the scenery, manages to perfectly encapsulate all of the game’s various themes, feeling creepy, romantic, mysterious, beautiful, and surprisingly realistic all at once. And of course, the game’s writing is fantastic; beyond the narrative itself, the frequent banter between coworkers Dr. Rosalene and Dr. Watts is heartfelt, genuine, and funny, with 99% of the humor feeling natural and well-timed. I was teary, wide-eyed with anticipation, and laughing aloud in equal measure throughout To the Moon and its DLC, but it felt far from an emotional rollercoaster; the jokes and feel-good moments blended seamlessly (and sometimes tragically) with the more serious.   TL;DR: If you’re into narrative-driven games, To the Moon is not to be missed, but be warned – for one reason or another, it WILL make you cry.",1,0

There are multiple endings of which some of them are incredibly hard to find out how to get to. I was not able to figure everything out for myself and had to look up a guide. Nevertheless I highly recommend this game, it left me with an incredibly overwhelming impression. And let's be honest, what can go wrong for just 10 bucks, right?",1,0

I am still only at the start but the game production value is excellent, there are lots of voice acting in key conversations and the story is building up well. The game looks modern and the GUI is fantastic, even though it is based on an old school isometric view. I am sure this game will keep any RPG fan engaged for many hours. It is geared slightly towards the action side and less on the story in the same way BG2 is to Plansecape. For those looking for something more like Planescape then they should check out the kickstarter for the new Torment game on the horizon.",1,0

You start with a certain party and then while you're advancing in the campaign, you get to unlock other classes or upgrades that improve the gameplay experience. It's worth to mention that the graphics are simple and the soundtrack is also very limited, but you might as well just turn off the music and listen to a radio station (something that I usually do). There're also the trading cards and achievements available, which is something that might add for the replay value factor. Overall, this is the kind of game to play bit by bit, I really don't recommend to experience for straight hours because it might start to wear down on you quite easily.",1,0

It may be the extreme blur effect the game has on it that causes this.  I hate giving a bad review to something that was given to me for free, but at the same time, I don't feel right lying about a game that I personally don't find good either.

I eventually did and I'm so glad I did because now I am addicted to high heaven with this game! It's massively improved on over the original and has (unlike the orignal) excellent pacing and direction. They story is always fun, interesting and outragous! I learned to LOVE all these characters too because they are just so entertaining and fun to watch! Combat can be repetitive but also overlooked because of the amazingly hilarous dialogue that pops up so very often, the loot hunting on always searching for newer and better weaponry, and just how easy it is to get in and play with your friends. Looking right now I can't belive I've already put 170 hours into this game and they were all worth it! Highly Highly recommend this game. Oh and there are lots of DLCs for adding more content to this game, all areas and the higher level caps are recommended.",1,0

I'm changing my review to a thumbs up.   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  *Original-grumpy review- Would be fun if it didn't crash every time I tried to play. Pretty long load times also make a frustrating play experience. I want to like it, but honestly it's so convoluted with the store and all the extra 'bells and whistles' that distract from the actual game; I believe it could have been so much better as a $60 full featured release instead of the piece-meal game it is.

273350,Evolve Stage 2,"I loved this game on release, it was fun, I bought into the hype they drumed up for the game, and it was interesting to a degree. However, the DLC is extremely overpriced, I'll give you some numbers for you to decide what to make of the costs, both individually, and if you wanted to be a fan boy who bought all the DLC available for a game.   So, for the 1st buyable tier of hunters out, as in one set of Assualt, Trapper, Support, and Medic, is $32: $8 per character. These characters do not earn that steep price tag, having only slightly varied skills form their partners. Are they different? Kinda. Are they fun? Kinda. While this is debateable as opinion, the price tag is still extremely overpriced for 2 slightly different skills, as 1 is always going to be class specific, and one will always be a gun. Next, you have the monsters, which, according to the $100 pack, which only nets you 2/3rds of the DLC coming out for this game, there will be at least 5, meaning 2 more monsters. With the price of the Behemoth at a grissly and whopping $15, you can assume the second beast will net another $15, meaning a total price tag of $30 for both. Now, also mentioned in the Monster Pack are 2 additional hunters excluded from the Season Pass, refering to a 5th tier of hunters. These will likely also be $8 a piece, meaning another $32 dollars, and without a season pass for them as well, lowering the net price from $32 to a barely excuseable $25, You're paying out the ♥♥♥ for another slight variation of 2 more skills per class.   For those of you looking for a bottom line, here's the math. At the Cheapest, to buy the 2 monsters, and 8 Hunters, you're looking, at cheapest, at $87 worth of DLC alone. The price of Skyrim at fullprice at release, and DragonBorn, it's entirely new campaign and slightly smaller scale Expansion at $20 at first release, with an extra $7. This is the price of the DLC alone, not the game, just DLC. This is a joke, there is not an entire game's worth of content in a decent handful of characters, limited to a simple 4 slot skill bank, if you want to count a gun and the class role as 'Unique' abilities as well, and 2 new monsters. The game is worth the price, everything above and beyond? A ♥♥♥♥ing Joke. And we're not laughing.",-1,0

Now thats not a huge problem but it destroyes the beliveabilty of the game and the connection you feel with the player.  2) The bugs/crashes and VC missing have been fixed but still its not excusable for a big company to make such mistakes while asking for full price.

This game is the breath of a fresh air that the Total War series needed for a long time. The various races have completely different play styles and the new monstrous units and war machines add a bevy of new tactical depth.  Here are the examples:  - Empire is more classic if you do not want to be too lost in a fantasy world - Dwarfs need to avenge any insults against them. If they cannot avenge, they face revolt and they are mistrust by other dwarfs allies  - Ork can chain victory to start Waaaagh that spawn armies to attack opponent  - Vampire can corrupt around them and raise armies at old battlefields  - Chaos ... ok it is like Attila horde (with giants monsters and spawned horrors)  Many years ago I played a couple of strategy games called Warhammer Shadow of the Horned Rat and Warhammer Dark Omen – this game can guarantee you a come back to good old days but with much better graphics and on a much bigger scale.  This game also runs very smooth on my rig, and it's going to be even better once DX12 will be added to the game soon.  Amazing game, if you'll get it – you won't regret it!",1,0

255070,Abyss Odyssey,"This game has some serious, SERIOUS flaws.   Ok, lets start with movement and combat. the levels were designed with the highest movement characters in mind, not the lowest. So trying to catch jumps and move with a lesser charcter is infuriating with this game. Some characters just outright don't grab ledges and i find that mechanic frustrating EVERYONE OR NO ONE! The combat goes from too easy to way too difficult and swings wildy back and forth in each zone. Doesn't really have a good flow and feel to it.  Item balance is also a serious issue with the camp tokens costing way too much for what they are.  I love the artwork and the story but this is going to be a challenge and a half to get anywhere close to beating.  With some tweaks this could have been an amazing title, but they didn't so it's not.",-1,1
261030,The Walking Dead: Season Two,"This game is very similar to the first one, so I'll spare the details.  The game is again full of great characters and places.

The dialog is great, but I think there are way too few scenes were you are able walk around and interact. That might be the developers intent seeing as you are now playing as Clementine and she is a little girl, not a grown up man.   Since it's a sequel it tied up a few things the first one left unanswered. I give this game a 9.5/10",1,0

318530,Wings of Vi,"To start I do recommend this game to people who enjoy trial and error there is a lot to punish the player and little to help. The jump mechanic used in this game will you put you in danger for almost every intricate jump you need to do. Boss fights are trial and error as well as RNG you'll feel as though you're making no progress and I feel that none of these bosses could be beaten within your first 10 tries excluding the first. The difficulty curve is at a 90 degree angle and though I love hard games I absolutely hated almost every level and boss in this game. The music feels out of place in a lot of the areas, and is very forgettable there's only one track I can remember off the top of my head. The art is actually pretty unique and beautiful. The controls are ridiculous, because later on you will get new abilities one of which is a projectile which is mapped to the same key as your melee you need to be close to an enemy to use your melee but the distance is messed up in situations and you'll end up pulling out melee and attacking obstacles rather than enemies. Usually even with these types of games you feel some kind of rewarding feeling in beating a new boss or gauntlet for the next save. In my experience I felt no reward whatsoever. It also feels like the game wasn't tested properly as if bosses, enemies, obstacles, segments were just tweaked to make it worse on the player. The game is still constantly updated and it's mostly to make things even more unforgivingly difficult. Finally the Final Boss....I got it down to 1 HP after 22 hours of attempts it throws so many ridiculous brutal unrelentless mechanics at you that to learn to even start fighting the boss you probably need about 5 hours of attempts or more. I can safely say I will no longer be buying games from this company as there are too many bugs, too many issues, every thing feels rushed and untested, and I was very disappointed with this game.",-1,1

105600,Terraria,"Introduction Terraria is a game developed by Re-Logic. The dev team are very active with this game, constantly supporting and adding to the experience, they are really great developers.  Gameplay Terraria is a sandox 2D adventure game that focuses mainly on exploration, building and combat. It starts in a procedurally generated world where the player is left with basic items to start the adventure and try to succeed in a very hostile and at times, unforgiving world.  In Terraria you will encounter many different enemy types from little slimes to huge mechanical bosses that are not easy to take down. The player can use melee, ranged or summoner to take out these beasts and the HUGE range of items and item recipes/combinations makes the game highly replayable.  Players house and interact with NPCs in order to progress through the world, with the first NPC being the Guide, whom can be used constantly to reveal all of the item recipes in the game.  Lastly, once you have become good at combat, you can try to become good at building, which adds a whole new element to the game, adding even more hours to your game time. You can build structures high up into the air that take up the whole background, or you can just build a simple lil house to go to sometimes in between fighting bosses, it's completely up to you!  Pros + Endless game time + Awesome weapons/items/enemies + Constant dev support  Cons - No REAL Story (you make your own adventure) - Online Multiplayer is too laggy   Result / Final thoughts For a game so inexpensive that can produce sooooo many hours of gameplay, it is crazy value for money. You won’t be disappointed by Terraria. It is my second most played game of all time (and I'm a Final Fantasy completionist enthusiast) and definitely one of my top 10 games of all time!  -MC ",1,0

The game was simple full of mobs and a really fun pvp exerpience. They just screwed up the whole game now. Adding on to the map was the wrong thing to do if anything they needed to shave a few 4-8 blocks off the orginal map. Now it's a game with no point to play and most of the time it will take you hours to find a player. They killed the community so if you buy this game consider it to be a single player game expect that 1/2 of the 20 players that may be in your server with you are out there hacking so they know right where you are.

8870,BioShock Infinite,The story starts out simple: 'Bring us the girl and wipe away the debt'. The thing is though there is much more to it than that. This game brings back Ken Levine's mind from the first Bioshock to create an amazing story that ties in with the same universe as rapture in the first two games. The DLC is spectacular as well. Most of the DLC actually explains the reasonings for the events in the first Bioshock. It is a good end game for Irrational due to them shutting down. I recomend every one go play all of the Bioshock's in order to get an amzing experience you can not find any where else.,1,0

271590,Grand Theft Auto V,"In the fifth installment of the Grand Theft Auto series, The game picks up with three very deep characters that you can grow to love or hate depending on how you view them. The roughly 20~ hour story is certainly something you'd not want to miss out on.   But that's only half of it. The other half is better.   With a thriving online community, and unfortunately not a great Anti-Cheat system, fun is always to be had. With consistent updates, there is always something to be done. However, all of this free DLC is slightly expensive in ingame money.... which is the worst part of this game. Updates are released and most vehicles or whatever are too expensive to buy through mission earnings, which is where Rockstar makes a killing on microtransactions. Overall, this game is worth it to one who prefers a casual game of hit-n-run with a fun experience for friends.",1,0

47890,The Sims(TM) 3,"I mostly just enjoy building things to be honest, but the gameplay is a step up from the previous generations of Sims. Also, the building itself has improved significantly from other Sims versions and EA has even provided a Create a World tool where you can build 100% customized neighborhoods/worlds.   Major downside - if you're interested in using the Create a World Tool, you shouldn't buy the Sims 3 of Steam because even after you register on the Sims 3 Website, the Tool exe doesn't recognize the installation path of Steam games and thus will fail to install.

297130,Titan Souls,"My playthrough of the game was rather short (just around 6 hours, including breaks). But this game is magnificently crafted, scored and stylized. Each boss fight feels unique and all the fights are boss fights. While the game is light on story, it is set in a colorful and imaginitive world that is brutally contrast to the intensity of the fights you'll have to face to reach the end.  On the point of the fights: each titan is unique and challenging in its own way, employing different tactics and abilities to force you to think about your approach.  I'd definitely recommend this game. I came here after watching EXP's stream, and hearing the music. At that point, I had to stop watching and play this for myself.

Do I want to bulid a shovel to clear rubble, or a knife to defend myself?  But if you take the time to examine everything the game offers, you will find that This War of Mine may be one of the best war stories ever told. Each character has a backstory which is only revealed slowly, agonizingly, as you forge through the uncertain days, and the treacherous nights. At no point are you even forced to confront the history of the characters. You must choose to invest in their identity and struggle, but if you do, you will experience the game as it was meant to be played.",1,0

200510,XCOM: Enemy Unknown,"I first watched on YouTube, as a guy in Slovenia played through it. I still love and play the original X-Com games from the 1990s, so I wanted to see the new version. I was a little disappointed to find out that the largest ground force the game allows is 6 soldiers. But I understand that to have the level of 3D graphics and framework, something had to give. And I enjoyed watching the game so much that I bought it on sale, even before I had a computer that would run it.  I've since been able to run the game on a monster system with 16 GB of RAM, and on my laptop which has only an AMD Turion X2, and only the minimum 4GB of RAM. On my laptop, the game loads slower, but otherwise isn't significantly slower, for me. On my laptop, I have to run it windowed, with all graphics settings on Low, but it runs, and I'm still having fun. I've been playing for months in real time. In saved games, I'm past number 2200. And I haven't tried any of the DlC, as far as I know, and have yet to try Enemy Within. I'll get to it eventually.  If you like turn-based tactical games, with some research and building elements, I think you should at least check out some YouTube video of game play. The old Time Unit system has been replaced with two actions that can be: move-then-shoot; for certain level-dependent options, shoot-then-move-or-shoot-again; or double-move. I don't miss calculating TUs in my head.  I hope you all give it a look.",1,0

I was pretty excited to get this on sale.  Immediately opening it, maybe it's just my machine, but the video was full of artifacts. There was clearly very little effort in porting this to PC from Xbox 360/PS3. Instructions are primarily for Xbox controller. I rolled my eyes a bit... I got this on sale, so not too offended.  Character selection screen: awesome. Level design: cool! Colorful, Warhammer-style conflict. This kind of game could've hooked me on for a really long time... in fact, I was hoping it would. Instead, weird-♥♥♥ camera angles make the game just about unplayable. Had to die a couple times just to get the camera in a sane location. The final nail in the coffin-- Crashes prevented me from beating the first stage.   Too bad. I was really excited.",-1,0

Well yes, actually the biggest challenge I have ever met in the gaming world, and so far (for me) it is almost impossible, if not completely impossible. However I am not complaining about 'it was waste of money' or 'I did not get what I wanted' cause I was warned about the extreme hardcore-ness of the game, by reviews and actual players. But there is something what I can't understand...Why is it good for the developers to create a game being this difficult as this one? And I thought Sid Meier's Civilization is the top of the mountain. No I am not a Big Wise ♥♥♥♥ Gamer Professionist, but we play games for success, and in this game it is something extremely rare. So I just simply not recommend, unless you are pro at strategy games (and in English :'3), let me say so far from these 3 hours I spent one and a half with the tutorial only (which was not too helpful but pssst). Simply, just not recommended for regular players, especially for people who are beginners with strategy games. But I enjoy it in the 'history nerd' way.

310560,DiRT Rally,"I've had a really great time learning to play this game. Still learning and practicing, but it definitely gets better with time. But no matter how good I get the tracks, cars, and weather challenge me constantly. I have played racing games casually since my teens. Played tons of the Gran Turismo series, with the most experience in 3. Played a fair amount of Forza Motorsport 4 on X360. But where those games were challenging up to the point where you figure out how to best the AI and no further, this game keeps on challenging me even after I think I've figured it out. It only takes one momentary lack of concentration to ruin a stage time.  Truth be told, I am terrible at racing games in general, but I enjoy the thrill of speed. In this game you really can feel the speed, especially in headcam. There are times where you will white-knuckle the controller, heart racing, and on the edge of your seat. You will cry when you hit the trees and laugh when you do a double barrel-roll and continue on. 10/10, will rage quit again. and again.  After a year and about 300+ more hours, this game still provides the same thrill as always.

43110,,"+ Amazing graphics (especially for its age)  + Awesome gameplay mechanics (i.e. military grade ammo is more powerful than normal bullets, but it's also used as currency; gunplay feels pretty solid and balanced, although I've heard the harder modes are much more difficult)  + Great stealth mechanic (almost every encounter has two or three ways around it: you can go in guns blazing or try and quietly take each enemy out or just sneak around them)  + Good use of horror (not Amnesia or anything but the dark, damp metro tunnels and harsh wintery wasteland of the surface combined with weird supernatural beasts known only as 'the dark ones' and glowing mushrooms make for some pretty suspenseful and creepy moments)  + Top notch storyline (it's based on a book, so if you're not sure about the game as far as that goes, pick up the book and see if you like the story)  - Somewhat clunky animations.  - Voice acting feels somewhat forced in some parts.  - Artyom (main character) doesn't talk much. (I don't really mind this because not only does he talk in between levels summarizing the story so far, but the actual dialogue in-game is set up to account for his silence, i.e. someone asks Artyom a question, and seemingly before he could respond they will say something like 'you probably don't care anyway right?' or something like that)  I could go on, but all in all it's a great game with a great for a reasonable price.

In the case of Crimsonland you get a constant stream of upgrades, perks, and unlocks to keep you wanting to play. In the case of Narco Terror, it just has so much retro action movie personality and explosions! But this? It doesn't really have much going for it.  - Oversaturated genre (zombies). - Muddy, dark art style. - Ridiculously fast zombies. - Slow, uninteresting upgrade/progression system. - No character customization. - Weak guns.",-1,0

372210,Spooky Cats,"The compelling story of a cat named well... the kitty doesn't have a name. But kitty has a mission : Save Penny (a human girl) and save pennies. Join kitty on an adventure saga of the ages. See her flushed down the toilet bowl, dodging ghoulish cats, slaying zombies, bats and mice. Watch kitty press levers, see an apperition of her dead mother, inspiring kitty to find penny(ies) and defeat the massive evil witch who has a lot more pennies than kitty. Will good triumph or will evil prevail, who will take all the pennies in the end? Those are the questions that had me biting my nails.   On a serious note:   Buy it on sale. It's on sale often. The game play is under an hour and there are about 17 levels. There's not much replay value unless you truly are invested in the plot and find Kitty's struggles inspiring.

From minute one i've had some huge scale battles completely down to the playstyle of the army something that couldn't be said for previous total war games. I'm yet to try all the factions but they seem to play completely different from facing them in the campaign. I'm greenskins - zero mircomanagement, with lots of full on battles with you suffering attrition if your armies do not fight often enough. On the scale of the battles - There's moments where I've had to pause the battles (hangs head in shame) because of the sheer number of troops i'm commanding and I just couldn't keep track of everything.  AI has improved from Rome 2 - I never did see Attila but Rome 2 AI was a complete ♥♥♥♥♥♥. The computer keeps to high ground and tries flanking manuvours.  I was worried after 20 or so hours of playing it would feel the same as previous total wars and burn out.

It uses the medium to its advantage and brings loads of insight into not only game development but also how we judge others through what they create. It's a unique experience that you won't be able to shake off for the next few weeks. Though it's short, it really is the essence of 'video games are art' and for me is worth full price.   That being said it is pretty much a 'walking simulator' but if that doesn't deter you then this is definitely worth checking out.

As a Predator if the human AI sees you even if you run away and cloak they may still know where you are, this happens rarely though. As a Human Soldier the different levels change tones a bit; in one you will be low on ammo with only a pistol, whereas the level before you had a combat shotgun that could one-hit Xenomorphs.

Better-than-average community that tends toward the older side (for gamers, that is).  The game took time to develop, but seems to be picking up the pace for improvements.  I don't usually like on-line multi-player games, but this is the exception for me.

221040,Resident Evil 6,"There is no rating system available here. It's just 'Yes' or 'No.' I can't say to stay away from this game entirely. There are merits. However, for fans of the RE series, this is an utter disappointment. I didn't play the game until it had been out for a year or so. I read the reviews ahead of time and thought, 'They are blowing this out of proportion. It can't be that bad.' Well, I was wrong. Compared to the other games in the series, it is pablum. It is generic. And I think that is the biggest criticism that I can come up with. It doesn't allow for a deep, immersive experience because it doesn't provide for an individualized experience. It takes you by the hand, tells you where to go, and lets you shoot in the meantime. The story element is intriguing. I enjoy having the stories overlap to tell a complete one ala the movie 'Go.' But this game is as generic as they come. When will developers learn that we would rather have a little exploration than a big explosion? If this game was producd by Michael Bay, I wouldn't be surprised. Let's hope they get this game back to what made it popular in the first place. Changing that is just dumb. Make another game if you want to cater to the explosive junkies. Don't ruin what you have built by catering to the least common denominator.",1,0

The Multiplayer is easily the best part of the game with fun fast paced and intense battles, with a lot of awsome maps and different Camander loadouts to make the game fun... Plus veicle skins are so SEXY! Company of heros 2 dosent live up to the 1st game but it is still incredbly fun.

8870,BioShock Infinite,"I have no idea why all the positive reviews. Maybe from casual gamers playing their first First Person Shooter/Role Playing Game? If this is the first RPG you ever play then it will feel like a good game. But compared to Bioshock 1 or 2 or most of the RPG games of the past 5 years, this game is bad. The story is simplistic. The combat is repetitive and too easy. Most of the game time is spent wandering around, opening barrels or trash cans to get goodies. A short burst of combat and then back to wandering again. You are supposed to be satisfied by going ohhh and aww looking at all the scenery. This is from the game designers official statements.

238320,Outlast,"Before you read on, here's a true story. I started playing Outlast for the first time on the same night I ate spicy Mexican food for supper. Within the first half hour of the game I got scared so hard combined with the poor digestion of overly-spiced food that I literally sh*t myself.  So there's that. Now, what is Outlast? Is it just another first person horror game? Well, basically it is, yes. But that's not a bad thing at all. Outlast puts you in a mental asylum gone batsh*t sour, arming you with nothing but a nightvision camera. From there on you'll sneak and crawl through the asylum. Unfortunately for you, you're not the only sneaking and crawling person in there.  There are no weapons (no guns, no chainsaws, no large purple d*ldo's or whatever tickles your imagination) to defend yourself with. You either run and hide or you stay and die. Is it that simple? Well it could've been if they had payed their damn electricity bills. The asylum you get to explore in Outlast is dark, and I mean dark dark. You will rarely be able to see without using your camera's nightvision function, and even if you use it there's a chance your battery runs out. Now THAT delivers an entirely different level of 'scare' to the table. There are jumpscares, I'll admitt it, but those will be the least of your problems. Your main problem is that you know you're not alone, and that you don't know whether you are or aren't. If you're tired of shooting your way out of scary s(h)ituations, treat yourself to Outlast. It's scary, it's atmospheric, and it's definately worth every minute you dare to spend playing it. Oh, PS: don't eat spicy food before playing. God damn me...",1,1

God damn masterpiece this one 14/10, It's a must-have (And so is Season 1!)

297860,Split/Second,"I would prefer BLUR over this game but i will recommend it ONLY IF IT IS ON SALE !!  This game has a brilliant idea which brings racing and explosives together. But this kind of racing game needs a lot of optimizations to be a fluid and playable game. I loved this idea and the episodic game but after completing the races and episodes, the game became boring. Because the variety comes to an end after the episodes are complete. All you do is trying to perfect the same races with same explosive options. And the gameplay is not that smooth. If you play with real people, it can be a bit more fun because humans know when to trigger events and they do not hold back. But again the clumsy gameplay kills it as you experience weird crashes. And there is a save file problem. This game has a bug that corrupts the savegame and you have to start all over. I have never experienced it thankfully, but people say it happens.  If you can buy this on sale and do not expect to play this for months and if you like maniac explosive action while racing, you could give this game a shot.

This may seem like a con, but keep in mind this is a driving sim where everyone drives completely recklessly. You don't want to hear what they are saying. These aren't the droids you're looking for.  Fast-pace activities, always something to do. Can completely ignore the activities if you want to!   Cons: All cars seems to drive alike, with minor tweeks (This one goes faster then that one, etc.) Including the Tank!! Goofy physics, but this might be a pro since doing just about any of these tricks would result in a fatality.  Since it's server-multiplayer only, long-term support is questionable.

Classes are well crafted, lots of customisation, multiple skill trees, for your class, for your horoscopes of all things, for your specs, its nuts. You can boost yourself up quickly if you are lazy and join multiplayer groups, everyone has surplus gear of classes they dont use, i've gotten heaps of gear from such people, your single player characters can be multiplayer if you want, its easy to switch back and forth.  I like how they have a simple respec system, content is great, i can micromanage stats and skills to my hearts desire and i can feel the difference, its the ARPG to buy folks, my favourite out of TL2, D3 and PoE!  My only small issue is with online people bugging out the game when they join or just the occasional crash, but its no big deal, it's possibly related to my meager internet connection.  Definetly worth a buy, especially considering this is the devs first game and the more successful it is the better they can make sequels and the like, Crate is a very promising dev team, and a surprisingly small team too!  And even more amazingly, they are STILL making more content for the game, in my book they beat all other contenders a long time ago, and they are still making more for us! sure its mostly paid, but at this point i dont care, all their content is varied and worth playing.",1,0
372000,Tree of Savior (English Ver.),"I'm playing this game and experience no lag. Probably because I reside in the US, where they put the server. I hope they will fix the lag issue soon for the international community and it should not be a problem in the near future. If you watch the game trailer and enjoy the art and class system, you will not be disappointed with this game. The game gives you great freedom to build your character with different play styles for the same class. Highly recommend this game",1,0

200710,Torchlight II,"Torchlight II is a really good game, but not a great game. It has an endearing art-style that's easy on the eyes, and the gameplay is addictive enough to keep you playing 'till the end (I played about 50 hours by the time I beat it). However, there is nothing about this game that is exceptional or raises the bar. The story isn't deep or engaging, and the world lacks depth. Had the developers expanded the towns and added sub characters to strengthen the plot, then this game could have been a bench mark. The loot drops are well-balanced and look decent, the world is visually appealing, even interesting in some places, and the monsters are well-designed. But beyond the relentless grind, there's nothing much motivating you to keep collecting and throwing away loot 'till the next boss fight, except more loot and boss fights, that is. If you're just looking for a game to help you pass the time without being bored, then it does its job well, but don't expect an engaging story to justify the 50+ hours you may waste playing it. In the end, I feel like I got my money's worth, but only based on what I already kind of expected.",1,0

410380,," I will update this review later with more extensive information.   Please note that my the amount of time I spent in the game is vastly higher than what is stated here. Have been playing before the game was released on Steam.   Hex is a true digital TRADING card game (TCG). Whether you are new to the genre or someone who has played many TCG's before, it offers a huge amount of gameplay. Jumping in is free and you can play through the single player campaign to get a hold of the basics of the game without spending a dime.  Besides that the game offers a lot of PvP activities like Draft and Constructed. Note that those option will cost you, just like other TCG's.   The game has an in-game auction house which allows you to sell and buy cards, as well the option to mail cards to friends. This is almost unique in digital card games and a huge plus compared to other games.  For now; Jump and try out the game :)",1,1

Garen is a knight that uses medieval technology to rekt his enemies. vaynes use trap and veigar uses dark gypsie magic. Overall I give this game a 10 out of 10 out of 10 because the graphic is beautiful in it's own way. The uhh, only thing that I don't like about the game is that the storyline kinda suck and it's not very rewarding. like -spoiler alert- After you kill the evil dragon alduin the heroes just look off into the distance and I was like 'What the hell are they looking at? their dead mentors?' because that was the most anti climatic ends ever. But, it's redeeming quality is the gameplay and that's where it's really shine. You defend this crystal thing that you can customize from the enemies/ ",1,1

209000,Batman™: Arkham Origins,"The game is good, technically speaking, as it is pretty much a copy of Arkham City. If you want more Arkham fun, then this is a perfectly fine game. My only problem with it is that they borrowed a bit too much from Arkham City. Even his 'new' gadgets are heavily inspired from other Arkham City gadgets. I call them the not-Line Launcher (Remote Claw), not-Freeze Grenade (Glue Grenade), and not-remote electrical charge (Concussion Detonator). Although the Remote Claw does have a few interesting uses in Predator encounters. However, the things that are new are still quite good as well. My only problem with the story was that they didn't put enough attention on the Assassins. Most of them are optional or only show up once. The only one with any real impact on the story was Bane. Other than that I love seeing Batman's first encounters with his 'gallery of rougues' as the villains are often reffered to as. Overall, I would still reccomend picking it up, but I would find it on sale first, or wait for an 'Ultimate' release that contains all the DLC (or at least the Season Pass). Oh, and one last thing, this game seems to take a noticably heavier toll on performance than the other two Arkham games, so expect to lower the settings a little if your PC wasn't getting perfect performance with Arkham City.",1,0

231430,Company of Heroes 2," CoH2  features a very rewarding multiplayer called “Theatre of War” with co-op and competitive options. There are plenty of game types to choose from with varied maps to play on. The biggest change to multiplayer is the revamped Commander Abilities System which sets you special abilities to use in matches to really bring the hurt down on your opponents. This fun and varied multiplayer along with a lengthy single player will keep you fighting on the Eastern Front for quite some time.  The visuals have greatly improved with  Relic ’s new  Essence 3.0 engine  turning the battlefield into a horrific and stunning spectacle. The detail level is very impressive considering the grand scale of the game. Battlefields are highly detailed with picturesque Slavic forest, large towns and cities all horrifically scarred by battle. Explosions, debris and gunfire look striking, shocking, even real and zooming the camera close to the ground lets you see how much detail has gone into the game, especially into the character and vehicle models.  The  Essence 3.0 engine  makes use of clever technologies like the popular physics engine  “Havok”, “TrueSight” , which accurately simulates a unit’s visible range and  “ColdTech”  for weather simulation. This works in unison with spectacular sound effects and a thrilling, rousing musical score. Controlling your men with outstanding visuals and amazing sound design will make you feel like the director of an epic WW2 movie.   Company of Heroes 2  is able to captivate RTS fans with it’s gritty yet gratifying take on WW2 strategy gaming. It’s action-packed, it’s fast-paced and a game for real armchair Generals. If you’re willing and able, pick up  Company of Heroes 2  and prepare to fight with your comrades for glory and victory.

10180,Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2,"This game is Good but not great. First off the muliplayer is a mess, in many ways it adds onto and improves on cod4's  mechanics (such as customible killstreaks and pro perks as well as more weapon diversity). But on the other hand you have  ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥t like one man army noob tubes, commando, deathstreaks, Akimbo G18, and danger close that ruin the games balance and enjoyment.    The single player campaign is good and tells a compelling story but there are some things that aren't well explained and can leav you confused. The spec ops mode is just the campain exept with coop, fun, but doesen't really hold your attention for that long so feel free to skip it. But what hurts this game the most is the optimization, never in my life have I ever seen a game so effortlessly ported to the pc. The game is locked at nauseating 65 FOV (field of view) which will automatically makes the game feel weird to play since you are essenially staring through a pair of binoculars, thankfully there is an FOV changer that you can download for the muliplayer so make sure to get that if you ever plan on getting this game. Plus there are, get this, NO DEDICATED SERVERS.   Yep, no dedicated servers, basic pc features are non exsistent in this game! The lack of dedicated servers is what killed this game, instead of dedicated servers we get a crappy host based matchmaking system where everyone has to leech off of one guys connection meaning if the host has a bad connection you will have to play with laggy hit detection for the rest of the match. Oh and who can forget the oh so wonderful host migrations? Also the game is filled with hacked lobbies up the wazoo and some of them automatically rank you up to level 70 and give you everything ruining most of the replay value. Overall Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 is a disapointment and don't let any fanboy convince you that it isn't. I wouldn't recommend this game due to the how many asinine descisions were made with the port. But if you are still intrested in getting the game then be my guest, maybe you will be more satisfyed by what you got then I did.",-1,0

I understand trying to change things, so it doesn't get stale, and to make it a little deeper. But in my opinion, most of these changes are for the worst.  You can't rotate guns this time around. You need materials to build guns to deploy on your ship, so if i have 8 laser turrets, and I better place them perfectly (without knowing where enemies are coming from), because those 8 are all i have, no selling and buybacks here.  The upgrade system is just completely ridiculous. Its an extra building (red, blue, or green), which upgrades the connecting hex spots around it, costing me a spot where i could've / should've used a shield. Red, Green, or Blue, you get an upgrader for each.  Oh, and repairing, that's a building too...

Addicting and compelling loot-motivated gameplay, RPG leveling-up, creative weaponry, and wonderful worlds of creative and extremely effective dialogue with references of memes to retro gaming, the first game to do such of what I can recall. But then, once the game loses that honeymoon luster, the game derails and becomes a heartless loot quest with bullet-sponges in the way, but your friends to liven the experience. A game that can't stand alone without the help of being enjoyed with friends comes as a weakness in design. I could have fun with my friends doing things none of us enjoy solely based on the fact we're suffering together. I love this game, one I might have played too much, but it could do so much more to take away its artificial difficulty and push beyond the comfort zone it created for itself.",1,0

The graphics remind me of the old days when i was a kid and games were made to have fun, this is one of the games where you can have plenty of fun with.  Pro´s - Fighting System is fun (not to long like some say) - Always something to do with your char (develop a rota, fight, train, train/fight, fight, tran...) - Massive Skill trees which can develop a feeling for the char you play - Managing your char is medicore difficult, in the beginniny you need to understand the dynamics and go from there. - Ingame Manual and Explanations are simple and sufficient - Retro Graphics and Soundtrack :) nice love it - 7.2 hours played so far 9.99 payed - so good value time/money  Con´s - Would like to invest in the house and pro gear, but have to go to the gym instead   If you like retro games, the 90´s and want to spend some easy going fun hours i guess this game can keep you for 40+ fascinated and atleast 2-3 runs with different chars just to try the different styles, boxer, ultimate fighter, asian style etc. The reviews about the stats crippling etc. can be ignored, they just play wrong.

Pick 2 Attributes suting what you want to do will pick the Boxer Strength/Constitution are his skills, keep them at same level, leave agility to 4 and lock it via skill.  1.1 Dont do more then 2 times construction work you dont want to get robbed, buy 4 meat from it and start train, sleep circle - repeat 2. Start Ultimate fighting when your attributes are something like 5-4-5 should be easy going and bring the gym cash. 3. When training also ask for training fights for 15 bucks = 2 Skillpoints (every 24hours) 3.1 Do the Fight Club when you can gives also free skillpoints think its 3 per fight so 15 in total 3.2 Get the Pizza Quest done and beat the hell out of the 'ninja turtles' but watch out they get more tough 4. Unlock the Bear Path and get the Punch that lowers enemy Stamina its hell of a difference  The rest figure it out on the fly good luck    ",1,0
20900,The Witcher: Enhanced Edition,"The game expects you to know everything from start and doesnt explain its 'how to' elements good enough, so you end up frustrated and wanting to smash the pc into bits. Wouldnt recommend this game to anyone.   For example. First it tells you to yuse left mousebutton to fight. 99.99999% of all games out there its a simple klick to fight. This game expects you to hold your left mousebutton, release it at correct moments and then hold again. All that it explains with 'click left mouse'  Example 2. It tells you to medidtate and shows a menu icon that looks in a special way. It never tells you that you have to go to an npc speak with it, open another potrate icon totally unrelated to what your journal shows you to access, to acually acess this menu, and heres where my ♥♥♥♥ing patience ended with this game.  Also you must use different sword-stances towards different enemies to be able to kill them making fights towards large groups pretty ♥♥♥♥♥♥.  On the positive side: Except for sexist boob armor/clothing on the only female character in the game so far I think the graffics is good for a game with some years on it.

401360,The Aquatic Adventure of the Last Human,"TL;DR: Very nice visual style, good boss fights, but that's about it.  Aside from the bosses, there is no combat or meaningful player interaction whatsoever. The game is basically wandering around looking for the next boss, and the nonlinear style and incredible hugeness of the environments make it occasionally frustrating, and honestly, a little boring. While there definitely is good lore, backgrounds do look amazing, and the bossfights are challenging and enjoyable, there just isn't enough there to keep me invested. This is all just my personal feelings, so if you like games where the only enemies are bosses, then get it. Otherwise, it's not very entertaining.",-1,0

Ubisoft delivered an amazing game, not just by it’s story, but all of it. I always thought that any other game could be better than the second one, but they made it. It’s not just entertaining, it has amazing scenarios and many, many places to explore. Another thing that impressed me was the weather system. I risk saying that it’s the best I’ve ever seen in a game. The only complain I have is about the PC version. It’s graphically amazing, but not well optimized. Nothing compared to ACIII, of course. Anyway, thank you, Ubisoft, for making me believe in Assassin’s Creed again.",1,0
208580,STAR WARS™ Knights of the Old Republic™ II: The Sith Lords™,"TL; DR: KotOR II is excellent, but unfinished. A must play for Star Wars and/or RPG fans. Play through it once without the Restored Content Mod and play through it again with the mod installed.  I have owned this game for a very long time. I originally played this game countless times on a disc, so my Steam hours do not accurately reflect the time I have spent with this game. I am one of those people that say that this game is better than the original (although the original is extremely good too).  Let's get this out of the way first. Knights of the Old Republic II is an unfinished game. It was rushed to release to meet a Holiday release date. As a result of this, many sections of the game were cut out entirely, including an entire planet, along with vital story dialogue with characters and an ending that actually makes some sense. I am aware that there is a mod that restores a good chunk of the cut content called The Sith Lord Restored Content Mod (which is very good by the way), but I will bring that up into more detail later.  Take the Star Wars formula that you know (Jedi = Good, Sith = Bad) and completely flip it on its head. It doesn't do a complete turn around, but you start thinking of the Jedi and the Sith more in shades of grey than in one being absolutely good and the other absolutely evil. You get more of a nuanced education in the Force from one of the best Star Wars characters ever, Kreia. Let's be honest here, Kreia is absolutely the best character in this game and is probably one of the best Star Wars characters ever, yes you heard that right.  In KotOR II, you play as the Jedi Exile, a former Jedi Knight that was kicked out of the order due to his/her involvement in the Mandalorian Wars. You were one of the Jedi that followed Revan and Malak off to war, and you were also the only Jedi that returned to face judgment. Ten years have passed since then and you return to find a threat facing the galaxy that hides in the shadows. What follows is a galaxy spanning quest in the same ship as the first game collecting companions to aid you in this threat while rediscovering your connection to the Force. It is one of the most unique takes on the Star Wars license.  But, as was said earlier, it was rushed to meet a deadline. A lot of vital content was cut from the final release, but the files were still in the game. A team of modders took it upon themselves to restore this content (what they could, anyway), and it is a crime that Obisidian was not given enough time to finish this game properly. However, I do recommend that new players do not play through the game first with the Restored Content Mod and save it for a second playthrough. Playing through it first unfinished and then switching to the mod gives you a much better idea of exactly how much stuff was cut, and how important the cut content really is.   If you are a fan of Star Wars, or of RPGs in general, then there is no question, KotOR II is a must buy.",1,0

200940,Sonic CD,"I remember playing this at my Grandma's house when I was a youngin'. As I recall, this was one of the only games I was good at when I was 4.

I may have a job, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to be conservative!) Regardless, I now have this game. I still really like it though. Not as much as Sonic 3, but still... I feel that this game is as fast as the other games. Some say it's slower, some say it's faster. I think it's about the same. However, this game does have this thing called the 'Super Peel out' and I don't think it has much of a point. You move fast and you're vulnerable when you use it. I don't get it :/ However, I think there's more stuff to bounce off of in this game. That's cool. I like bouncing. Sorry, I don't really have much to say! I really, really like this game. It's not my favorite, but I still really like it. The graphics are awesome, the music's great, It's sonic through and through. I recommend it on the grounds that I enjoy it as well.

275850,No Man's Sky,"This game was promised a lot. It was said to have lots of things but I'm here to tell you that most of that stuff is a lie.  Let me start with the promised *multiplayer*. Everyone who has seen this game a couple months ago knows there was suppose to be multiplayer. That this game had no loading screens and wow it was AMAZING. Well sir/lady this is where you are wrong. There is no multiplayer. sorry to bust the bubble but it had to be said. A day or two the dev said *No mans sky is NOT a multiplayer game.* Whick prettymuch said HAHAHA ♥♥♥♥ YOU ALL. It wouldnt be that hard to tell people it isn't multiplayer for 5 years but apparently you gotta lie about it.   Second thing is gameplay and technical issues. I do admit This game is fun to an extent. I have played this game for already over 24 hours and I had fun. There was a few glitches but everyone else the game crashes and has LOTS of fps issues. so they also lied about the min requirments. Not just that but There is close to NOTHING TO DO!!! You can either spend 1000+ hours to get to the center of the universe or explore. And when I say that i'm not joking. The center of the universe is WWWAAYYYY farther than it should be.   Another thing is the planets. Once you get a warp drive all you do is *Go to planet, get resources, buy new inv space, make fuel, leave.* Thats for EVERY SINGLE PLANET. Not just that but Inventory management is a Dissaster in that game! I dont feel so bad on it but they could of made it a bit easier.  The third thing is the AI. The aliens that you talk to mostly are just like *I need this* or *What blueprint do you want.* Then you pay them to do a wide varient of things that are mostly completely useless. While on this topic the starship fights are good. I like them and they are pretty fun.  But the biggest topic I have here and now is, once you explore enough and you realize you just need to warp the game gets SOOO EASY!!!! On planets, in space, I haven't died a single time! The game is suppperrr easy and it just irritates me. If you want a difficult game this isn't for you. And if your into grinding and like space then go play starbound.  Overview: This game is full of lies,grinding,and being as easy as watching tv. I HIGHLY don't recommend this game it seriouslly isn't worth it.  ",-1,0

241930,Middle-earth™: Shadow of Mordor™,"A few hours into the game and I'm loving it. The pre launch hype was not too overblown and the actual gameplay is solid and fun. Combat mechanics are great, fluid hand-to-hand combat, decent stealth elements which are also driven by goals, and what every good combat game should have -- an awesome bow! Thus far the story line is unique and ties the gameplay elements together nicely. The duality of both Talion and his wraith companion makes the staple 'vision mode' elements and slow motion kills not seem too out of place, in fact it is the opposite. The nemesis system is a fantastic addition and creates some truly standout moments that will almost certainly be different for each play through. Nothing quite like the feeling of falling to and Orc captain and having him get promoted and taunt you the next time you cross paths. The game is not without issues but they are mostly minor complaints: the camera sometimes locks in strange places or completely freaks out and occasionally there is some pathing issues with Assassin's Creed style free-running. Overall I am really loving the game so far, a solid 9/10.  If you want to see my experience in the game you can check out my profile for Twitch stream highlights and my YouTube Let's Play.",1,0

384190,ABZÛ,"Most people will see this game one of two ways. One way see's it as very boring. They'll see it as nothing to do, and nothing but a glorified walking simulator that's too short. The other will see it as a beautiful love letter to ocean, and the nature as a whole. They'll see it as a joyus exploration of the world we inhabit.  ABZU is the most beautiful game I have ever played. There are times when I'm nearly brought to tears by the stunning atmosphere. It takes you on a lovely journey through the ocean, and gives you as much time as you need to explore and admire the incredible scenery. You can interact with fish, swim swiftly through the currents, or take moments to reflect and enjoy the sea life around you. It's a game full of supprises and in my opinion, totally worth it at $16. Seriosuly, buy it on sale while you still can.  Let me tell you something. At about what I preceived to be 3/4ths of the way through I thought to myself, I'm going to refund this. It seemed way too short and while it was fun, it wasn't enough. That's what I thought. But boy was I wrong. This game saves its best cards for last so it's worth it to stick around. I don't regret spending money on this. It was an amazing experience the whole way through, but it wont be for everyone.  If you're the type of person who is looking for a good bulk of content, then this isn't necessarily for you. If you're the type of person who needs conflict or objectives to stay engaged in a game, then this isn't necessarily for you. If you're the type of person who see's absolutely no value in the idea of a 'walking simulator' then this isn't necessarily for you.   But if you love the ocean, and you love exploring, and you're willing to spend $16 for a game that is a diamond among coal, then buy it, and finish it. Take your time, and enjoy every bit of it, because games like these are a rarity, and we should do are best to support them.  Do I recommend, ABZU? Yes, but it's not for everyone. Know what you want in a game, and if you need an idea of the pacing or game feel, look at Journey. The less you spoil yourself on ABZU gameplay the better.",1,0

252450,StarDrive 2,"Star Drive 2 is a worthy successor to Master or Orion 2!

If you get it, some things you need to know (or the AI will kill you, treaty or no):  * Build Corvettes: You can build your CP in Corvettes free of charge (in CPs), so your fleet should be normal ships and in addition #CP in Corvettes. And get to your CP limit - otherwise the AI WILL attack, treaty or no. And look at the tutroials  * You need your fleet(s) Unlike MoO2, your alone Starbase won't protect you from early raids, a devent fleet can destroy it even very early in game. However, your own fleet (max CP) in addition to the Starbase will work, even against fast expanding races  * Expansion makes your neighbors nervous.

Gameplay, I had troubles in combat the first time I tried it out on the tutorial section, it's so tricky to use, but you get used to it soon or later, and will able to use it to the max. The interface is minimalistic and the inventory is well made. One thing I love about the inventory is the fact that we're able to sort it according to weight multiplying to the amount the item has, very useful for inventory weight based games (which a lot doesn't have this feature). Crafting, enhancing, and trading is also well balanced.  The story, I haven't advanced that much in the game, but the plot is interesting indeed. Aside from the main story there are also lots of other quests to play through.    Conclusion   Beautiful Hack &amp; Slash RPG Game, well balanced gameplay features and interesting story to follow.",1,0

226740,Monster Loves You!,"The nice thing about Monster Loves You! is that it's not for you as a seasoned gamer, but for your children (with or without your help).  You start your journey in a pool of goo, and from that slimy craddle to your comfy grave, you're confronted to numerous adventurous situations, in which you'll have to decide how you will react. Depending on your choices (presented as text options) you'll progress into branched mini-stories, receiving or losing points in a serie of traits like Bravery, Cleverness, Cruelty, Kindness and so forth.  From an adult perspective, the game might seem unchallenging and you'll really enjoy the last part, dedicated to politics and community management. But from a child perspective, the game offers alot of behaviors to explore, and to learn that choices have consequences - both in short and long term. And it's possible to be really really mean too - you're a monster after all and nobody will punish you for that.  The art is cartoony and childish (of course), and the langage proper to the young audience. Even if the total play time for a character's life is short (about an hour), it's possible to come back once in a while to have fun guiding another creature in the path you've chosen.",1,0
67370,The Darkness II,"Great writing, amazing visual style and good gameplay variety combine to make The Darkness II something that shouldn't be missed by anybody.  The gameplay would be standard fare if it wasn't for the inclusion of The Darkness mechanics, which serve to stirr things up with some RPG advancement to get new abilities and also as extra options to the more standard shooting. Things like grabbing enemies, tossing environmental objects and outright attacking with the darkness is used in combination with the more traditional gunplay.  This combines with another mechanic that forbids you from using you powers when on light, and you have the makings of a great game that tries to mix things up as you go along.  Very, very rewarding game to play.",1,0

But that's just because i'm lazy sometimes...go to steamapps, common, Rogue Trooper, executable, and in properties change it to Windows 7. May be Vista or something else in your case, just try.   Ten years after release this looks very dated indeed, but plays well enough and is a fond trip down memory lane to when stuff like this, Kill Switch and Gears was still relatively new. If you like the comic then obviously you will like this, but even if not then it's a decent third person shooter with shades of Killzone in terms of feel and mission structure (which in turn was heavily influenced by the Rogue Trooper comics).   Some features don't work properly, like controller support, but mouse/KB is generally fine for this.

You see, I recently installed it for a Original-Windows computer that had been before used by some guy called 'SimonPhoenix' or something like that, and thank god I didn't spend the 60$ in there (25% offer).  I personally felt like ♥♥♥♥, the game lagged, if it was about to load something, it crashed, and to top it off, the computer had something strange that turned every program like if it was inactive, which closed the program's fullscreen each 30 SECONDS.  I was about to throw the computer away...until I remembered that my Macintosh had Windows on it. I have to say, even if my Macintosh is maybe the best computer out there, its system (OS X) works like ♥♥♥♥! So, after I stayed ANOTHER day waiting for the download to finish  When I played it, I almost cried of happyness. It worked like the best and it was really fast.  Moral of the leson?

221040,Resident Evil 6,"This is not a recommendation, exactly. No, sirree. It's a bit of a warning.   I've played almost all the other iterations of the Resident Evil series (and enjoyed them), but this one is simply punishing. And that makes it largely un-fun at times.   I'm not implying that the controls, or the game itself, are broken - in fact, the dialogue, the characters, the cutscenes, and production/creature design, are quite good. Those aspects I enjoy. It's more like the game simply isn't sure what it wants to be (action, thriller, horror, shooter, co-op, stealth, etc.), and in so doing, tries to shoehorn a little bit of everything. And doesn't do any of that particularly well. It's the age-old issue of quantity over quality. Personally, I find that all that variation really disrupts the tone of the game, which is supposedly survival horror with action elements.  There are many lethal cutscene QTEs, and a plethora of 'races' away from insta-kill threats. In some cases, you get both - over and over again in a single event. And more often than not, the events themselves are too long - making it difficult to complete without making some critical mistake. After which, you have the option of continuing from checkpoints - which penalizes you in the in-game report-card-style ranking system at the end of each level.  It's also not helped by an AI ally system that is, at best, occasionally helpful/useful.  It's a 50/50 shot, that in the midst of a minor scuffle, he/she will be able to save/help you. And it's much more likely the AI will be haplessly fighting something else (or off-screen, making a sandwich) while you're getting curb-stomped by enemies.   I'd liken the gaming experience to feeling more like studying for an important exam, frustratingly trying to memorize where to be and where to go, just to pass. It's less suspense from horror and environment, and more suspense from not wanting to die and do the level over.  As a fan of the franchise, I'll continue to try and power through this game, but for the most part I'm somewhat disappointed in the turn the franchise has taken.",-1,0
49520,Borderlands 2,"Awesome game, even after all this time there is still plenty to do that keeps me entertained. There's been a lot of DLC; which has added things to do and at the current price of the game it can't be beat.  The final difficulty modes add a level of challenege as well.",1,0
250560,Fight The Dragon,"Note: Reason to why I have so few hours into the game will be answered also in the review.   Firstly the game goes the easy ( read: lazy ) route of block-graphics ( Minecraft-inspired ). If you hate it then I think this game is not for you. I personally don't like it, but can handle it if the game is good.  This seems like a nice concept: Hack-n-Slash game with community content and custom dungeons and LOOTING!!!! So what we look for in this game is how fun it is to LOOT, how fun the classes and their development is and how good the combat feels. Let's see how it fares. In those 3 aspects.  Looting in this game seemed quite decent. I mean you get frequent chests, you get monster drops and 'higher-value' chests and also something like a 'boss'-drops. The system where you can 'donate' junk and gold to shrine to 'pray' for random good items for various slots is also a nice gamble and adds to all of the Gearing up aspect of an Hack-n-Slash.  The combat is where the game falls flat and by a huge margin. By no means is combat any fun. The hit detection is abysmal. I feel this game has worse or more difficult combat than Dark Souls for PC and that game aims to be difficult and challenging. Half the time you will be missing the enemy because you're not facing them, that's okay... half of the time when you are facing the enemy you still won't hit it, because your cursor is slightly off! Now even with everything angled right the hit-boxes are drunk and sway around the actual model.   The classes... You have 4 classes ( 2 mages, a warrior and a semi-warrior )... All of whom mostly swing their prefered weapon, at least at the early levels. Now I want you to pick ANY 4 heroes/champions/classes from an MOBA game and imagine having a GRINDING RPG game built around them... you have 4 abilities that hardly ever improve or feel different for all of the gear grinding and loot farming. I said 4? Yes that is if you play with each and seperate one, but mostly you'll be stuck with ONE.  I might have a bit biased oppinion, but that's what this god-awful combat system got me to. I have few reviews and generally prefer to write pleasant and good ones about games I like, but for me to write a negative one, the game seriously must SUCK.   I understand that the game is popular amongst some of you people, but so is Minecraft... and hell if I knew why..  ",-1,0

35140,Batman: Arkham Asylum GOTY Edition,"The first Batman Arkham game is full of atmosphere. There are confrontations with seven of Batman's famous villains, the best of which for me are the Scarecrow segments. Although limited, the grounds and buildings of Arkham Island provide a rich backdrop and the story sets up the next game, Arkham City, very nicely.  There is also an Easter Egg which, unsurprisingly, no-one discovered. There are absolutely no hints at it and the gamemakers made it public six months after release.  The fighting is fun, with a good set of gadgets to be earned throughout the game and some nice moves, especially the inverted takedown. A great start to the ongoing Arkham series.",1,0

The game's great engine is what makes it a great shooter with dynamic lighting, perfect sharp shadows and nearly every object destructible. The ability to slow time temporaly and horror element is what makes F.E.A.R an unique game.  The main campaign is 7 hours long (it was really fun and interesting) Extraction Point is 3 hours long (This is where the real horror begins) Perseus Mandate is 2 hours long (I had to speed run on my first playthrough because levels and enemies were too repetitive and it felt like an eternity)  F.E.A.R is not even that scary, its mostly about shooting soldiers to death and walking through nightmare scenes that supposed to scare you so much that you turn off your pc.",1,0

This can run on mid and low grade computers, as long as youre OK with lag. Buhriz and Peak are good on lower grade computers, and are fun maps to play. I don't think I can tell you anything else to make you want to play, so BUY IT! Oh, and also, this game is very well rounded, and the guns actually are reasonably ranged, so you dont get COD noobs CQCing with snipers or sniping with pistols. Trust me, I tried both, it does NOT work. Well rounded, accurate, epic, epic, awesome and epic. Nuff said.",1,0

And please, put the pitchforks down, I know and understand why the fatigue system is in place but that doesn't mean I like it.

337000,Deus Ex: Mankind Divided™,"If you liked Human Revolution you'll like Mankind Divided it has similiar game-play but its more fleshed out and has more Augments to play around with, my favorite new one being the Remote Hacking Augment because it makes stealh playthroughs easier. Also the level design has seen a step up too and there is a lot of different approaches to take for each mission. The game mostly takes place in Prague but its a really interesting hub to explore and gets more interesting to explore as the game progresses.  The main story is average at best and has a few interesting points to it but overall falls flat and ends rather abruptly. I assume Square Enix is saving some extra content for DLC or the game was released before it was completed, story-wise at least because the gameplay feels complete. Were the game really shines is in the side missions, which are some of the best I've experienced in an RPG since the Witcher 3. The side missions are usually multi-part and take place across the span of the main story, most of them have really good payoffs story-wise.  The Graphics are good and it runs really well on medium settings on my AMD Radeon R9 390X 8GB, I could probaly play the game on High settings just fine but I hold off on that due to my CPU's heat output. Also the music is as amazing as you expect, which makes sense since the music in Human Revolution was good too.   So Overall Mankind Divided is a good game that could have been close to perfect if the story was more fleshed out and there was more than one hub world to explore. If you liked Human Revolution and want to play more of that but with more interesting augments to play around with than give Mankind Divided a buy.",1,0

The game is actually pretty damn funny and the story isn't that bad since the fact the balance between humor/seriousiness doesn't make it so bad and you can enjoy it.

351340,Belladonna,"I appreciate the intent of this game. Few titles dare to look at the issues of domestic abuse or a protagonist in a same-sex romance. But it didn't succeed in its execution. The characters don't leave any lasting impressions (the central characters, despite being in a relationship, show no real emotion towards one another), too much of the story is told through journal entries rather than having revelations occur naturally, and the conclusion is very lackluster. Some impressive concepts were brought up, esp. the concern of whether or not those brought back lacked souls/humanity, but this question was just abandoned without any further discussion. Additionally, the puzzles are too simplistic, with no real challenge or sense of achievement. Belladonna would have worked better as a short animation than as an interactive story.",-1,1

I was a backer of this game, and let me tell you, with a two years delay and the amount of money they got, I was expecting so much more. The story takes a while to get into, the voice acting physically hurts my ears and the combat is meh. It doesn't make you care about the characters at all, and the RPG aspect is pretty weak. And boy, is it pretentious, with it's complicating sounding names and cliche mythology.   Extra complaint: The dialog between characters switches constantly from a fixed 2D portrait of them talking (like a dating sim) to a pseudo animation in 3D that only shows the end frames. Yeah, it's a minor issues, but the inconsistency is driving me up the wall.   I'd give it a 5/10.",-1,1
438490,GOD EATER 2 Rage Burst,"For $50, you're getting both God Eater 2 and God Eater Resurrection which is the HD remake for the first game originally on the PSP. The game is basically faster-paced Monster Hunter with an anime art style and an actual story contrary to MH's story of 'kill ♥♥♥♥'. It also has a great soundtrack overall, both during missions and during cutscenes.   The one downside is that the dub is pretty hit or miss, and there is no option for the Japanese voices (thanks Bandai Nacmo). Some of the characters are actually really solidly voiced, but at the same time some are dreadfully bad.   I won't say that it is better than MH, but it is definitely on par with it in terms of both pure entertainment value and how much play time you will get out of it. For reference, at the time of this review, I'm on the Level 5 missions on GE Resurrection and that is with 20 hours of play time, and there are 14 Levels of mission difficulty. So yeah, plenty of content. Between both games, you're easily getting a quality ratio of hours played to dollars spent.  ...And I would like to have more people to play the multi-player with, so take that into account to when considering getting this. Please.",1,1

391540,Undertale,"Listen, this review can be summed up in just a few words, and if that's all you want to hear from me, just look at the conclusion and rating. But for those of you nerds who want to know a little more, keep on reading.  GAMEPLAY  You know, gameplay doesn't get much more simple than this, yet quite frankly, it can turn from an easy, walk in the park, to the most annoyingly painful experience in your life. Undertale is a cool game, because of the metaphor it seems to be based on. And that is that the choices you make in life, are what make your life, your life! Undertale is all about the choices you make, and how they impact your gameplay. You can become friends with everyone and have the happy ending you dream of, or kill everyone you come across and gET STUCK ON THE LAST BOSS, ♥♥♥♥ YOU   SANS  ! (Whom I still have not beaten...) Who would have thought that this game can make you both question ethics and share some of the best laughs I've had in a while. There are so many charming and wonderful characters to befriend, as well as annoying and evil ones to kill, but in Undertale, the choice is yours.  GRAPHICS  Well, it may feel a bit underwhelming at times, but this is a very pixelated game. Now it's not painful to look at, so I wouldn't say they are bad graphics, just low resolution. But in a game like this, you'll find that it doesn't matter. Plus, that means you can run on a potato like me and be able to play!  COMMUNITY  You know, I like this game a good bit, and it will remain something I'd recommend to those who aren't too big into video games, and even sometimes those who are. But never will I understand why some people love this game as much as they do. Sometimes it just gets creepy... But yeah, not a terrible fanbase, but not a great one either. Not that it matters too much, as this game is single player.  CONCLUSION  It's a good game! Don't expect to love it, and don't expect to hate it. If you don't want to fork over ten bucks, watching a YouTuber play it is a very similar experience.  RATING  7/10; a bit underwhelming at times, yet extremely overwhelming at others.",1,0

As a student, I could only play with a 100% focus + joy during holiday time which is quite short. Hence, I'll be back to this one once I finish the third series for sure.

There's more action, more players and the changes to the hunters and monsters are ultimately for the best. Turtle Rock Studios know they screwed up with the 'DLC ♥♥♥♥ storm' on launch. The game now has everything earnable in-game and the grind is not bad (it's better than earning IP in league of legends).  The founders have complained even after receiving 30K silver keys (In game currency), but really I think the best gift they got was having this game filled with players. This game is free, you have nothing to lose. Playing monster and winning leaves you with the shakes after because it's so intense. Playing hunters is a nice action romp with some teammates.",1,0
345350,LIGHTNING RETURNS: FINAL FANTASY XIII,I had heard some bad things about FF:Lightning Rerurns but since I played FF-XIII and FF-XIII-2 I tried it anyway and I have to say while it is nothing special it isn't terrible either. The plot was nonesense and cilche same as FF XIII and XIII-2 the gameplay in my opinion is a major improvement from the previous ones. It's full of crapy fanservice I have nothing against fanservice but its hard to take the game seriously when the protagonist is fighting dressed in BDSM costume I couldn't take the game seriously because of the stupid plot anyway.  I won't say I didn't enjoy it but I had no fun playing NEW GAME+ and don't be fooled by my playing hours I had to get all the achivement even if I had to cheat I never finished it second.  As for buying this game for those who didn't play FF-XIII and FF-XIII-2 you can pass this one its nothing special although if you are curios enough then go ahead.

I have never seen such a fun to work with, and easy to use crafting system in any other MMO. It is easy to grab the materials you need, level it up, and build the next gun, sword, motorcycle, or armor with. This game will keep you entertained FOREVER. There are no seperate servers, but rather just one big one, so you will always have players at your side and truly have that 'MMO' feel all while not fighting over drops that NPCs give and the such. This is also one of few games that traveling far distances is actually enjoyable in. This game is absolutely HUGE and literally takes hours and hours to cross an entire region.

298630,The Escapists,"The Escapists is without a doubt one of the best games I have ever played. The game is all about trying to escape a prison. While that might seem like a simple task (because it's a videogame, not real life), it's actually quite challenging. The game has a surprisingly deep strategy behind it, as you have to plan many things while maintaining a varying prison schedule. It has many tense moments that grasp the player into a deep concentration and fills him/her with excitement and anxiety that only this kind of game can produce. The developers have also confirmed a level editor where you can create your own prisons and support for multiplayer. However, one should, if he/she plays the game blindly, notice the brutal learning curve, as this game can barely be played without help from a video or a wiki. But, that doesn't stop me from recommending this game to one of my peers. If you can, buy it now, and you'll see how it's definitely worth the money.",1,1

268050,The Evil Within,A game that 'fun'part of the game base on how gamer expect... If they want a game that player want to use guns to kill all enemy this game can be suck game... If they want a game that want a 'touch and complex' story this game can be suck game... If they want a game that compair with other survivol horror game on the market this game may not the one you want to... But for me this game is a good game that blend this and that of experience from the past game that developers create.  As a Nintendo fan this game make me remind of how I like Legend of zelda series... they have number of dead count like Zelda game they make me think about weakness of enemy and boss more than just shoot more bullet like every fight can be a puzzle to beat. and you can beat game without any upgrade is how good game design can make.  For me this game is one of the best survivol horror game with good gameplay concept (if you not compair game with other game you like) and after beat game once... the reward is you can play as RE game for fun and challenge.,1,0

268500,XCOM 2,"I'm writing a new review now that I have had a chance to try the Alien Hunters and Shen's Last Gift DLCs.  TLDR: Great gameplay, very well designed, but buggy as hell...play at your own risk.  I think the thing that bothers me the most, and ultimately prevents me from even considering a thumbs up review, is that there are some of the same bugs as were present in EU/EW. The bugs range from graphical glitches (stuttering, delayed effects, discolorization, etc) to game-ending if you're playing Ironman mode. For a game that is intended to be a hardcore strategy game with an Ironman mode, there are simply too many major bugs present. Here are a few of the more annoying bugs: - Walls/ceilings will sometimes be transparent to gunfire, but you won't know until an enemy shoots you through it. - Units occasionally change floor level within buildings (rare but can be bad when it happens) - Graphical stuttering can cause you to click on the wrong tile as things shift suddenly - Timing of events can get out of whack such that events occur that should not. For example, one ability gives you a free melee attack against any enemy that approaches within one square. This reaction attack should occur before the enemy unit has a chance to attack, but sometimes it gets delayed and the enemy gets an attack in first. - Masses of dead, flying, flailing robot bodies prevents player from ending turn. Amusing to watch, but frustrating because reloading to an earlier save in the same mission  does not fix the issue . I will note that this is an issue specifically with Shen's Last Gift, so clearly they spent too much time making DLC and not enough making things work properly. ...and many more!  So what's good about the game? Well, if you have a high tolerance for bugs, the gameplay design is quite good. I have definitely rage-quit for extended periods of time after major bugs kill a session but when things are running smoothly there's an amazing game hidden beneath the bugs. Both the DLCs mentioned above provide new interesting gameplay material that, if they weren't riddled with bugs, would be very compelling as DLC.",-1,0

427030,Xuan-Yuan Sword: The Gate of Firmament,"This Game is simply ...WOW.. i mean, see for yourself.  The Game maintains one of the best storylines i ever experienced so far. ( And i played a lot of RPG) It has everything you want and need in a good RPG,   On a scale 1 (bad) to 10 (excellent):   Battle System - 7 ( Not really new - a mixture of half roundbased and half Active-Battle - similar to FF13-3)  Lvl. System - 7 ( the Skilltree is a nice asset )  Story - 10 ( a lot of drama, you get to know every feeling a player can feel - all ups and downs of ones heart )  Content - 8 (there is a lot to quest and search outside the main story if you want to. Carefull !!! Some of the sidequest are intertwined with the main story witch makes the questsystem unforgiving in terms of missing something/ failing quests)  Graphics - 7 ( There are better graphics out there but this game does a very good job with what it has, and believe me, some of the lights and enviorments are really beautyfull )  Animations - 6 (some of the Character movements and mimics are looking really plastic, but it is enough to communicate the feelings to the player )  Sound FX - 7 ( Ok but not really new, you heard alot of them)  Voice acting - 10 ( even though i dont understand chinese it feels as if i mostly understand what actors are saying through their mood in their voices, great voice acting here. And yes, there are subtitles too ... =) )  Music/Ost - 9 ( The music acompanys the story and the emotions in this game at a great level. Its mostly a main theme witch is composed over and over for every aspect of the game. Witch is not bad, in this case even very well made   Overall : 8 - A great game where the passion of the makers lies at most in the story and the dramatic events.  You want a solid RPG then buy this one",1,1

Does not really look like a puzzle game, it's more of a fast paced nearly impossible kind of game, something like Super Meat Boy, Impossible Game, VVVVVV, etc. As some people know, this game was first made as a flash game released on Kongregate and Newgrounds, many people really loved this game, i knew about this game for so long and have always wanted the steam version before remastered, couldn't get it since many people have been talking about how bad the game is due to the horrible framerate on it. But it is very nice how they made a remake with a different engine instead of flash. Something like the guys from The Binding of Isaac did, since their first game was built on flash and capped 30 fps. But i gotta say, this game turns out to be awesome now, specially controller support. Tinybuild is a company that has been bringing so far many weird and amazingly creative games to us gamers, starting with the very well known Speedrunners.",1,0

251290,The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky SC,"Who Should Buy this Game? If like me you thoroughly enjoyed playing turn based JRPG’s before 3d gaming took off, then you will enjoy this title, you will get addicted. All of the characters are interesting, the plot is deep and interesting. While there is lot of dialog, very little of it is filler.   Pros • It will take a long time to complete both chapters,  • I was at a loss when I finished my 143 hour playthrough of first chapter and second chapter, there’s not many companies producing games like this one • Sadly, games are not made like this anymore. I wish more games had strong and likable cast of characters, good music and a fun and interesting plot with decent gameplay mechanics. • You can retry battles, when you lose (Fights also get easier after each retry so you are   never stuck). • Decent turn based strategy, with a variety of customizable skills   Cons • There is a ton of dialog, which can slow the pace of the game. • There is no way of skipping or speeding-up battle animations. • It’s easy to miss some quests. I missed some for the first guild before I got the hang of it. • Agate (Though you will like him towards the end of SC)  //Rant about games, in general//  Story is often an afterthought these days. Final Fantasy used to be the market leader for telling an engaging story. Its latest entry isn’t going to see any improvements here either, due to it being an open world game.  Open world game mechanics take away from the plot, Wither 3, Fallout 4, Elder scrolls and all MMOS suffer from this.   While I have enjoyed games from these genres, they all lack a tightly focused plot.  It’s hard to feel the importance in finding Ciri, when you can spend hundreds of hours playing random games of Gwent, collecting Gwent cards, horse races, boxing matches and several other large scale side stories. The main story becomes just another side quest in an enormous list of quests getting more and more diluted as you move through it.  //Rant over//  Conclusion Trails in the Sky has its problems, however they don’t ruin the experience. It is everything a decent JRPG should be. Many of these flaws can be overlooked depending on preference.  Unlike the games mentioned above, Trails in the sky has an awesome story, that keeps getting better the deeper you get into the game.",1,0

524600,Dark Parables: Curse of Briar Rose Collector's Edition,"I bought this Game just recently in the Steam Winter Sales as I have been waiting for ages for this Game to go on Sale and I must say I dont regret it.  Dark Parables: Curse of Briar Rose Collector's Edition comes with the Main Story which is around 3 and a half hours long and a Bonus Chapter which gives you another half to an hour. It also comes with Extras, such as Wallpapers, Music, Mini Games and Concept Art. For the first time in a Point &amp; Click / HO Game I actually saw that there was a bit a backstory to read within the Game.   This is the First dark Parables Game in the Parables Series and I must say although the resolution was unchangeable and there was no Steam Overlay, I did really enjoy it.  It reminded me a bit of  Midnight Mysteries  just with a far less Grimm Art Style. The Voice Acting was surprisingly good compared to other HO / Point &amp; Click Games and the atmosphere was gorgeous!   It seems that this game just like Midnight Mysteries actually do depend on playing them inline unlike Grimm Legends where you can just play them backwards Numbered if you so wanted to.  Similiar to Midnight Mysteries this Game also comes with a Strategy Guide that helps you via Pictures and writing to find your way if you lost it or help you on Puzzles if you get stuck on them. Which is to me personally a huge plus so I dont need to alt+tab out and search for half an hour on the web.  The Hidden Objects were very well hidden and sometimes difficult to spot especially to its low native resolution. However once you get used to it, you should be able to find your way around just fine.  All in all this Game is a great &amp; Atmospheric Point &amp; Click / HO Game that I can recommend to anybody that loves a good story or those Kind of Games. However due to the fact that this Game is rather short with hardly any Options in the Settings Menu I recommend getting it on Sale as its base price seems a bit to high.",1,0

268050,The Evil Within,"Very under rated game. Looks great and ran smooth as butter on my 780 ti. If you were a fan of RE, in particular RE4, I would highly recommend this game. Very high replay value much like RE4 and others. Weapons to unlock and upgrade and much challenge on the higher difficulties. Plot is interesting while the characters and voice acting isn't great but who expects otherwise or cares ;) Plently to enjoy about the game besides the game play to make this go on for days. If you are on the fence I would pick it up.   You can explode zombies with a crossbow.",1,0

402430,Out of the Park Baseball 17,"After purchashing OOTP 17 I must say I have enjoyed this game. Last year was my first OOTP purchase and I found that 17 has vastly improved from OOTP 16.  My favourite feature about this game was that you guys fixed the sim times. The game goes by way faster now. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT! And honestly if that was the only feature to be added I would have been satisfied, but I was also glad to see the inclusion of player-opt outs.  I really don't have any complaints about this game, however I do have some suggestions for next years game.  Prospective Features:  1) I would like to be able to hire more than one scout and have them scout different areas of the world. I think having 6-10 scouts at your disposal would really help with discovery quality talent.  2) Sticking with adding staff to this game I'd like to have the ability of being the President of my team. It would be nice to give the orders to the GM through the owners. Or I could just play the part of President, GM and Manager.  3) I'd also like to see the possibility of having a Minor League Coordinator. Someone who basically keeps the GM in the loop in regards to player development.  4) In regards to contract negotiations with players who want an mlb contract I'd like to have the ability to offer a signing bonus to lessen the year by year salary. I've tried to not offer stupid contracts, so sometimes I'll sign a guy and restructure his contract to the point where I'll frontload almost half his contract if possible. I don't like doing that though because I have to go into commisioner mode and I feel like I'm cheating the game when I do that. (Just on a side note can we tone down the contract demands of some players. I've getting demands of upwards to $45 million)  That's basically all I have, but I'm sure I'll think of something else later. All in all I really enjoyed playing this game and I look forward to playing OOTP 18 in the near future. OOTP has the best baseball game on the market.  ",1,0

243120,,"Betrayer is a first person, open world, survival/stealth game. and it took me only 4 days to beat it.  You, the protagonist end up in a shipwreck, being the sole survivor of it. as you are washed upon a small island, infested with loads of threats.   as a game, graphics are quite nice, the style of design where you can only see black/white and red (which is aparently tweakable), the audio is incredible, so realistic. you'll feel as the wind blows draging you into the world.   as for the enemies...Have you ever saw a large spanish warrior that yells as a bear? Enemies are quite well done but, man they are annoying but the biggest inconvinience is that the variety of the enemies is quite low, there are like 8 types of enemies (including subclasses) that may get a bit boring, as some of them just stop appearing after you beat seartain part of the game.   Another problem of the game is weapons. Yes there are some like, 5 weapons and the variations of them are jsut the same textures with different stats, which makes it a bit repetative.   As for the story there is also some wierd 'Other world' thingamajig that i will keep quiet about. Just for you to check it out yourselves, there are not a lot of 'Living' characters that adds to the feeling of isolation and hostile enviroment.  Overall it is a nice game, i definitely recomend it, try it out. You won't regret it. And plus give those guys a credit they just started to work as a standalone team and i'm sure the second game will be much better.  enjoy your play",1,0

I wasn't sure about it at first as it is a little different platform and the main characters are retired villains, but I have loved it. It has quite a bit of humor and it is fun to watch the characters try to remain villains while they are being heroes and saving the world. I look forward to more games by this developer.

203160,Tomb Raider,"One of a hell of the game. It is a tomb raider in which you will die. Many times... there is not so much tomb raiding as in the first games, but i feel that it is OK.. although certain challenges are repeating, I do not feel less being able to enjoy the story. Lara is simply trying to survive.. that's all it is about.. at one point you will be so hurt that even higher jump could kill u so u needed to get to medical supply.. at one point you loose all your upgraded guns and you are left with a bow.. i am like maybe in the half of the game (dunno) but I find this survival parkour Lara as a nice refreshment. Story is not as interesting, but it is still nicely done. The mystery of Himiko might not be the main point of enjoyment of this game. But still, I really recommend it. 8.5/10",1,0

316010,Magic Duels,I love to play the game but if I had anything to say about it such would be how very many games I have lost because the game will often skip giving me an opportunity to use creature abilities during the opponent's turn. For instance - if I have a creature that can tap an opponent's creature and I desire to do so before the opponent attacks the game will often skip over giving me a chance to do so and I will be attacked even though I had an answer for the attack. Very frustrating and it effectively nullifies a whole class of cards I would like to play.,1,0

If you like motion sickness and wandering around a floor for long periods of time trying to figure out where the next room is, (because the hallways have no lighting and usually look like walls) then this is the game for you",-1,0

7940,Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare,"This game is great and one of the best Call of Duty ever.  It was the first time COD series to move away from World War theme, right to contemporary battlefields, and they did pretty well.  This is the last Call Of Duty i really enjoyed because after this all series kind of look the same.. the newer games aren´t that bad, but seems like the producers just found a formula to make a lot of money and they don´t want to change anything while this formula coninues to selling a lot. Besides this, the posterior games became more friendly and oriented to console users, wich is bad for PC/Mouse gamers.  Back do COD MW, the plot is great, captivating and full of twists. Now you can use sophisticated weapons and techonology, command air strikes, between other nice features.   Maybe some people won´t give value to some of the features this game has, because they are common stuff today, but when analyzing a game you have to put it in the context, and at the time of this release the game was really good, fresh and sort of a innovative.  I don´t know how is going multiplayer today, when i used to play it was very populated but i never enjoyed COD for MP so i stick to SP campaign and that´s worth enough for me.",1,0

365590,Tom Clancy's The Division,"95 hours played in 5 days.. That should give you some idea how I feel about this game.  Overall I'd give it an 8/10 in its current state. There are a few things that need to be worked on and balanced, but the developers are actively communicating with the player base on sites like Reddit &amp; Twitter in order to come up with some good ideas and ways to fix broken things. The devs are listening &amp; communicating with us &amp; that doesn't happen very often!  The gunplay is awesome. The cover system works great. There have been a lot of people complaining that the AI are boring, however, as someone who has completed dozens of 'Challenging' missions over the last couple days I can tell you that they are anything but. You can fight the same group of mobs 30 times and they will constantly change their tactics based on how you play.  Once they get a few issues worked out (Dark Zone &amp; Phoenix Credit related issues) and we start getting new content (DLC + Expansions are already planned) I imagine I will be upgrading the 8/10 to a 10/10.",1,1

219640,Chivalry: Medieval Warfare,"Holy ♥♥♥♥, is this game fun. But it's definitely a niche market. Not only is it a shooter, but melee is frantic paced. The kind where it's fun to win but sucky to get killed one tenth of a second after your initial charge into the fray.   Archery is as hard as balls (only ever effective at long range when the enemy doesn't see you), but also annoying for anyone on the receiving end. Vangaurd is probably the most imbalanced, able to get 2 kills in one swing.  The game has several interesting modes such as objective, the timeless king of the hill, death match, resource (sort of, highest score wins before highest deaths losing), FFA death match and time attack (I think), and the current maps are fairly unique. Avatar emotes are well varied and don't really ever get old - always will there be the volley of warcries with each extended sprint before the fray, and the appropriate laughter that comes after getting speared or having your head asploded with a mace - teabagging is less common, probably for that reason alone!  One on one duels, while very fun indeed (probably this game's most major selling point and the reason why they were so common in real life around this period) aren't as common as you'd think - naturally, when there's lots of players on a map, people are going to mob up, yet simply charging in still presents a disadvantage. You have to aim your weapon and aim your block. Hence, players tend to be cautious - adjusting their swings. In mobs, this still presents the risk of friendly fire - and people will always be mad for it (just like people are always mad at archers, but not vanguards; I guess vanguards are still thought of as cool).    For a big guy with a reach weapon, one swing makes everyone dash for cover, while a lighter attacker is going to be bobbing and weaving about, laying into the enemy whenever possible. Circle strafing is a challenge, since movement isn't as floaty as you'd find in a game like halo or even gears of war (which has been described as 'magnetic' in the past); anyway, 'floaty' is the verb I'm going for, so try to imagine that. Chivalry involves less of it. Simply shifting slightly to the left is enough to screw up an attacker's cunning thrust or a vanguard's mighty charge.   Current Rating stands at: 8/10  For me, this game has a lot of replayability. Simply having torn banner studios add in a few new weapons (there's many stemming from the early to late 13th-15th century vague time period reflected in this game's setting) that could create endless new strategies.   Lowered rating, because the game is still very punishing to noobs and really, anyone that doesn't have their game on. On the very negative side of things, I was presented with a lot of connection issues involving laggy gameplay and games simply not showing up on the selection screen. Rejoining or rebooting the game fixed the latter issue.   Players can get away with a bit of team killing mischief and it can be confusing figuring out how to ban them until you know where they are - banning involves a vote from all players, but the majority vote system prevents any real 'tyranny through democracy' issues in even low population games (most require 55% voting yes to get someone banned from a game rather than 50 or 40 percent). I haven't found any bugs yet.   Server settings offer quite a bit of customization as far as I can tell, which might allow hosts to cripple certain players favouring certain play styles. For no particular reason, I found that weapon upgrades can be disabled on some games - wasting the dagger kills I was earning.  Anyway, that's all for now.  ",1,0

8600,RACE 07,"I bought RACE 07 and some DLC's on the Steam Summer Sale. I haven't played many hours of the game yet, but I can already say if you should buy this game or not.  This game is totally worth it if you: A) Have a decent wheel with Force Feedback B) Have a computer that can run the game on high or max graphic settings (I have a gaming computer, not very good, but not bad either. Can run it with atleast high graphic setting and still have good FPS) C) Can drive realistic (you don't need to be a fast and good driver, but atleast brake at the braking points, hit apex and generally control the car you're driving. If you are a pro driver at Need for Speed it doesn't count)  The force feedback is fantastic in this game, and so is the handling of the cars. It feels like a game from this year if you ignore the graphics (graphics are good at high or max settings, but not the same as most games from 2013 and 2014). AI also feels nice. In this game you can't point the wheel in the direction you want to go and floor it. No, you have to fight it! It is a proper racing sim, you hear that?  This game is a masterpiece.  EDIT: I would like to add something that might help you understand how good this game actually is. This game is better than most racing sims released after this was released. Most of the realistic driving and racing games released the last years are worse than this. I am mostly thinking about the realism of course (AI, handling of cars, and so on).",1,0

Customizing your weapons, crafting items to carry more grenades or learning skills to improve your shooting will improve your chances of survival in the jungle.

43110,,The save system is pretty terrible. Right now I'm stuck in the middle of the city with no filters. I keep dying after 10 seconds. And there is no way i can see that you can go back without restarting the entire game. I started with 12 filters but they each ran out in about 30 seconds. I don't understand this game.  I mean i guess the game is fine on easy mode but anything harder than that and you die from running out of air filters for some reason  I suck at the game but I think the atmosphere and story makes up for the glitches and annoying things,1,0

This game, despite its age, still holds up well, and is still fun. There are still a few online players about, alas not that many. The game is really polished and plays almost the same as UT2004 in a lot of respects. It's also, by todays standards, very light on system requirements. My 3D video card blew some caps, so I'm stuck with a fairly old Intel integrated chipset, and it still runs smoothly even at high resolutions. If you can get a good price UT99, or as part of a discounted bundle, it's definitely worth getting.",1,0

620,Portal 2,"Uh  Not too sure what to write here so heres a recipe for Pancakes instead   Ingredients:  1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour  3 tablespoons sugar  1 tablespoon baking powder  1/4 teaspoon salt  1/8 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg  2 large eggs, at room temperature  1 1/4 cups milk, at room temperature  1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract  3 tablespoons unsalted butter, plus more as needed   Now to make it  1. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and nutmeg.  2. In another bowl, beat the eggs and then whisk in the milk and vanilla.  3. Melt the butter in a large cast iron skillet or griddle over medium heat.  4. Whisk the butter into the milk mixture. Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture, and whisk until a thick batter is just formed  5. Keeping the skillet at medium heat, ladle about 1/4 cup of the batter onto the skillet, to make a pancake. Make 1 or 2 more pancakes, taking care to keep them evenly spaced apart. Cook, until bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, and the undersides are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Flip with a spatula and cook about 1 minute more on the second side. Serve immediately or transfer to a platter and cover loosely with foil to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining batter, adding more butter to the skillet as needed.  6. Procedure for adding fruit to pancakes: Once the bubbles break the surface of the pancakes, scatter the surface with sliced or diced fruit, or chocolate chips, nuts, etc. Flip with a spatula and cook for 1 minute more. make sure you don't burn them.",1,1

311210,Call of Duty: Black Ops III,"Black Ops 3 has excellent multiplayer because it features awesome maps and a great movement system. The wall-running and thrust-jumping is integrated smartly into maps. Not all maps use wall-running heavily, so you get a broad experience. Maps like Breach use it nearly perfectly as you run behind advertising billboards or along buildings. All 12 maps (13 with nuk3town) are excellent and have good variety with heavy emphasis on three action lanes. The small maps have a lot of depth for their size. Nuk3town is even tolerable now because there are no noob tubes and the scorestreaks are more subdued. If you were a fan of the RC-XD in BO1, then the HC-XD is tremendous—it hovers over water and can drive along walls.  The thrust-jumping is not like exo-jump in Advanced Warfare because it is slower to ascend and you can also hover. It is not hard to learn, but managing thrusters can be crucial to avoid death from falls or during combat. The thrusting speed is not so fast that you cannot hit moving targets, but the third dimension helps to surprise targets and opens up the combat brilliantly.   Specialist characters are new to the series. These are not classes because you can use any perk or weapon from the Pick-10 system. Each specialist has a unique weapon and ability that recharges slowly, boosted by kills. You might get a flamethrower or a lunge knife attack that makes you deadly for a short time, but you are just as vulnerable. It adds some personality to the matches but keeps the core shooting intact. The specialists work surprisingly well and you will likely find a few good specialist characters that you can rank up.  Online connectivity on the PC is good. All servers are dedicated so the pings are pretty low and there are no host migrations issues. Matchmaking worked pretty well, quickly finding games in popular modes. Also had many close games. Performance online is also decent, maps load fast (15 seconds) and the experience is quite smooth. The game does love RAM though; it can consume 12GB in the campaign with settings on high, and about 8GB in multiplayer matches on the same settings. This will depend on your graphics card though. The game is well presented, with neat things like water simulation, smoke shadows, full-body awareness, detailed faces and audio improvements.  The campaign is not the best in the series but it now features full co-operative play with up to four players. Minor changes come with co-op but some technical issues are a bit annoying. At nine hours long, the campaign is probably the longest in the series to date. This length is almost certainly the result of large combat areas where you get to kill lots of robots or soldiers before moving on—mainly designed for the co-op experience. The story is interesting at first but quite unsatisfying by the end, especially when it shares almost no connection to the previous two Black Ops games.   The whole package in Black Ops 3 is impressive in value, with plenty to unlock as you progress. There is also the Zombies mode, which is a little confusing through a beautiful city, and a Nightmares mode that puts zombies in the campaign. But the multiplayer is main reason to buy Black Ops 3—it is one of the best the franchise has produced.   Read the full review  [www.newgamenetwork.com] ",1,0

94300,The Dream Machine,"The Dream Machine is a nice, short point-and-click game with puzzles that make sense and a promising storyline. It's surprising that they managed to make reasonable graphics out of cardboard and modelling clay exclusively. The music is nice and soothing though it does give a bit of an eerie feel to the whole thing.   Unfortunately, there is no voice acting, a point where I do think there is room for improvement. There are only a couple of hours of gameplay (took me about 2 h to finish both chapter 1 and 2); this, however, will probably stop being a problem once all six chapters have been released.   Sure, I'd recommend this game to point-and-click puzzle lovers but be forewarned that it's a really short gameplay and you get no closure after finishing a chapter as it is 'to be continued...'.",1,0

The best part of it, is that it is linked to my mobile version of this game via WB Account, so some of the achievements in the mobile version unlocked certain extra features in this game, which is absolutely great.

365300,Transmissions: Element 120,"A fun little mod for sure, and at just a single hour's length it isn't a big time investment at all to try out, with an atmospheric first half and a bombastic combat-focused second half with a unique modified weapon. I suffered one crash during my playthrough, but luckily the autosaves are frequent. The mod includes achievements, so while it is short, there are a few challenges to increase replay value for those who want to play it a second or third time. I would say just go play it and judge for yourself due to it's short length - as such the remainder of the review contains some gameplay spoilers:  The unique element of the mod is a gravity gun that fires exploding energy balls, and can be used to rocket jump by firing below you as you jump. It was a fun mechanic, but it felt a bit underused. There are just a couple of arbitrary moments where you are forced to use it to reach a high ledge, but in combat it is seemingly optional, since the game kits you out with pretty much the entire gallery of weapons from Half-Life 2. Ammo is a little scarce, but not entirely, making the game feel like it sends mixed messages a little. On the flipside it does mean you can play with either the new weapon or have a more traditional Half-Life experience, but it does mean neither option is particularly tightly designed. You also don't get the modified Gravity Gun until about halfway through the game, which was a surprising factor considering it's the mod's selling point. It feels like the guns are there as a get out of jail free card for when the gravity gun runs out of charge, but I'd rather it retained it's standard close-range jolt to stun enemies, so you can run away and recover - perhaps make it so this mechanic also allows for long jumps for retreats without causing damage to enemies.  The first chapter was nicely designed with the darkness providing some neat gimmicks. I'd be lying if I said I didn't have to really work up the courage to descend into the pit of zombies, despite being well-familiar with them from multiple Half-Life 2 playthroughs over the years. The crescendo at the end of the third chapter felt more fun and exciting to use the new Gravity Gun, with tons of toys and traps to manipulate with it to wreck hordes of zombies. Meanwhile the fourth chapter's finale encounter felt like the epitome of my 'mixed messages' criticism, where rather than being used creatively for combat, the gravity gun instead is just a means to get around and collect a finite amount of rockets to take out Striders in a very traditional manner. While two cranes can be shot to drop shipping containers on the Striders for a very satisfying payoff, once both those chances are used up, that's the end of the only creative idea the finale has.  Overall, I feel if this mod is intended to serve as a proof of concept for this gravity gun idea, it has succeeded very well, the idea has great potential. I just wish the mod was overall more focused and tightly designed around it, I'm sure some more creative things could be done and the reliance on showering the player with typical Half-Life weapons could be axed. If however, the mod is just meant to be what it is, it still succeeds at being a pleasurable experience from start to finish.",1,1

Level up 7 different classes and swap between them (in-game as well, between waves). Many weapons, many maps, many different enemies and a fairly active modding community. Plus!
